			<Text>Godswoods are wooded areas, enclosed within a castle's walls, that have been set aside as places of worship and meditation dedicated to the Old Gods of the Forest. They are centered around a single heart tree, usually a weirwood tree with a face carved into the trunk.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]One such godswood is located in Winterfell.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Red Keep also has a godswood but, being a rather recent castle, it has no weirwood tree. Before the Andal Invasion, all of the castles of the First Men in southern Westeros had godswoods in them. After the Andals conquered the south they took over many of these castles, a large number of which are still standing today (particularly in prominent regional capitals such as Riverrun, Casterly Rock, Storm's End, and Highgarden, to name a few). While the Andals replaced the worship of the Old Gods with their Faith of the Seven, most of them kept the godswoods in these ancient castles (possibly because outright destroying them would have greatly angered the First Men they had conquered). To this day, there are still godswoods in southern castles such as Riverrun or Highgarden, but they have been converted into secular gardens instead of active religious centers. Even King's Landing has a godswood. The only godswoods still in active religious use are those in the North (such as at Winterfell), or the handful of noble families in the south that still worship the Old Gods, such as House Blackwood in the Riverlands.</Text>

			<Text>House Stark of Winterfell is a Great House of Westeros, ruling over the vast region known as the North and the Vale as Kings in the North from their seat in Winterfell, recently retaken by the Starks from House Bolton. It is by far one of the oldest lines of Westerosi nobility, claiming a line of descent stretching back over eight thousand years. The head of the house is the Lord of Winterfell. Before the Targaryen conquest, the leaders of House Stark ruled over the region as the Kings in the North. Jon Snow is the current King in the North and the Vale, partially due to the allegiance of Petyr Baelish, the Lord Regent of the Vale, to House Stark.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Their rule in the North seemingly ended after the events of the Red Wedding when House Frey and House Bolton betrayed them, after joining alliance with House Lannister. Roose Bolton personally killed King Robb Stark. Both the North and Winterfell were taken over by House Bolton, but their hold was jeopardized when Sansa Stark escaped their clutches after learning that her brothers Bran and Rickon Stark were still alive. House Stark were restored to their former stature after the Battle of the Bastards albeit at great cost with Rickon's death. Their success in this battle later leads to the resurgence of House Stark as the royal family of the North, with its vassals declaring Jon Snow as King in the North.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]House Stark's sigil is a grey direwolf on a white background, over a green escutcheon. They are one of the few noble Houses whose family motto is not a boast or threat. Instead, the House Stark family motto is a warning, one that no matter the circumstances will always be relevant: "Winter is Coming".</Text>

			<Text>Eddard Stark was the head of House Stark and Lord Paramount of the North of the constituent regions of the Seven Kingdoms, and House Stark is one of the Great Houses of the realm. House Stark rules the region from their seat of Winterfell, and Eddard also held the title Lord of Winterfell. In addition, he was the Warden of the North.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Eddard was the second son of Lord Rickard Stark. Lord Rickard served King Aerys II Targaryen as Warden of the North. Eddard's older brother Brandon was Rickard's heir. Eddard also has a younger sister Lyanna and a younger brother Benjen. Eddard was a stoic, dutiful, and honorable man and was considered to embody the values of the North.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Eddard was a trusted, close friend and counselor of King Robert Baratheon. He supported Robert's play for the throne by acting as a general in several major battles. Eddard's sister Lyanna, who was betrothed to Robert, was purportedly kidnapped by Prince Rhaegar Targaryen, igniting a war. Brandon protested the kidnapping, but his attempt to bring Rhaegar to justice failed. Lord Rickard was summoned to court in King's Landing by Aerys, and both Brandon and Rickard were brutally executed by the Mad King.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Their deaths left Eddard to inherit Rickard's responsibilities, serving King Robert instead. Brandon had been betrothed to Catelyn, and Eddard also inherited his brother's bride. Lyanna died in Eddard's arms during the conflict. Despite his happy family life, Eddard still felt the losses of his family quite keenly, often visiting his sister's tomb to light a candle for her as his daughter, Sansa, remembered. Despite barely knowing each other, Eddard and Catelyn formed a strong and loving marriage, and had five children, Robb, Sansa, Arya, Bran and Rickon. Eddard also had a supposed illegitimate bastard son, Jon Snow, apparently fathered with a common serving girl, Wylla, but in reality Lyanna's child with Rhaegar, whose heritage Eddard kept secret from everyone, including Robert and Catelyn, which would become a source of occasional friction between Eddard and Catelyn, who remained ignorant to Jon's true origins.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Eddard's other younger sibling, Benjen, still lives and is a member of the Night's Watch, an institution of which Eddard is a keen supporter. He also appeared to have troubles keeping his bannermen in line as Stannis Baratheon remembered his brother, Robert, saying the Northmen were difficult to control, even with Eddard on his side.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Eddard wielded a Valyrian greatsword named Ice (an heirloom of House Stark) which he used on ceremonial occasions.</Text>

			<Text>Jon has more Stark-like features than any of his half-brothers. He is graceful and quick, and has a lean build. Jon has the long face of the Starks, with dark, brown hair and grey eyes so dark they almost seem black. Because he looks so much like a Stark, Tyrion Lannister notes that whoever Jon's mother was, she left little of herself in her son's appearance. Out of all the Stark children, Arya Stark is said to resemble Jon the most, as Robb, Sansa, Bran and Rickon take after their Tully mother, Catelyn. During the Great Ranging, Jon temporarily grows a beard.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Jon looks solemn and guarded, and is considered sullen and quick to sense a slight. Due to having been raised in a castle and trained by a master-at-arms, Jon is seen by some lower-born members of the Night's Watch as arrogant at first, though this changes when they become more friendly towards one another. Jon is observant, a trait he developed on account of being a bastard. He is a capable horseback rider and is well practiced in fighting with a sword. Jon has resented his bastard status most of the time. He desires to be viewed as honorable and wants to prove he can be as good and true as his half-brother, Robb. Jon dreamed he would one day lead men to glory, or even become a conqueror, as a child. He feels strongly about not fathering a bastard himself.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]While Lord Eddard Stark openly acknowledged Jon as his son and allowed him to live at Winterfell with his half-siblings, Jon felt like an outsider nonetheless. While Jon has good relationships with his siblings, especially Robb, with whom he trained since they were children, and Arya, whom he sees as somewhat of an outsider as well, Eddard's wife Catelyn, who was especially annoyed when Jon bested Robb in training or classes, ensured that Jon was never truly one of them. Jon is not close to Theon Greyjoy, Eddard's ward. Lord Eddard refuses to speak of Jon's mother and the boy grew up unaware of his mother's identity, something which has wounded and haunted him. When Jon dreams of her, he considers her to be beautiful, highborn, and kind.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As a northerner raised at Winterfell, Jon keeps faith with the old gods. He eventually discovers that he is a warg, being able to see through the eyes of his direwolf, Ghost, when he sleeps, and experiencing Ghost's feelings and senses while awake.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]After joining the Night's Watch, Jon dresses in their official black garb. Later he recieves a cloak that is very similar to the one worn by his father Eddard, made by his sister Sansa.</Text>

			<Text>Eddard's Heir[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Robb was conceived during the first fortnight of the marriage of Lord Eddard Stark and Lady Catelyn Tully - on the wedding night at Riverrun, according to Catelyn. While Eddard rode south to fight in Robert's Rebellion, Catelyn remained at House Tully's castle. Near the end of the war, she gave birth at Riverrun with the aid of Maester Luwin. After war ended Catelyn travelled to Winterfell with Robb.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Robb was raised at Winterfell as his father's heir, and is the closest of companions with his half-brother Jon Snow. Robb and Jon trained together at arms ever since they were big enough to walk, and played at being mighty knights and heroes. Once, Robb and Jon built a great mountain of snow above a gate. They were spotted by Mance Rayder, then a brother of the Night's Watch, who had accompanied the visiting Lord Commander Qorgyle. Mance promised not to tell on them, and the two boys eventually dumped the snow on Fat Tom, the slowest of Lord Eddard's household guards, who chased them around afterward.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]After Greyjoy's Rebellion in 289 AC, Eddard brought to Winterfell a hostage, Theon Greyjoy, the last surviving son of Lord Balon Greyjoy. Robb came to befriend Theon and enjoy the elder boy's company. Theon joined Robb and Jon in their training at arms, and Robb and Theon trained at swordfighting at the staircases of Winterfell.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Recent Events[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Robb attends the execution of Gared and discovers a litter of six direwolf pups in the snow. He claims one of the direwolves for his own and names him Grey Wind. Shortly after the court of King Robert I Baratheon arrives at Winterfell, Robb spars with the crown prince, Joffrey, using wooden swords. Bad blood develops between the two when Joffrey challenges Robb to spar with live steel. Ser Rodrik Cassel, Winterfell's master-at-arms, does not allow it, to the mockery and chagrin of many of the present Lannister retainers.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]When his father Eddard is named Hand of the King to Robert and journeys south to King's Landing, Robb remains in Winterfell to rule in his father's stead with the help of his his mother, Catelyn Stark. She later travels to King's Landing after an assassin tries to kill Bran Stark, so the responsibility of Winterfell falls solely on Robb. Robb and Theon Greyjoy rescue the crippled Bran from wildlings and deserters from the Night's Watch in the wolfswood.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]After word of Eddard's arrest in King's Landing for treason against the late king Robert's successor, Joffrey, reaches Winterfell, Robb calls the Stark bannermen to war. His youth and experience is questioned by his father's bannermen, such as Jon Umber, but he manages to unite them behind him. When Robb marches south to the riverlands, his motives are to support his mother's house, House Tully, in response to the invasion of Lannisters from the westerlands, and with the ultimate goal of freeing Eddard.</Text>

			<Text>Gods be good, why would any man ever want to be king? When everyone was shouting King in the North, King in the North, I told myself ... swore to myself ... that I would be a good king, as honorable as Father, strong, just, loyal to my friends and brave when I faced my enemies ... now I can’t even tell one from the other. How did it all get so confused? Lord Rickard’s fought at my side in half a dozen battles. His sons died for me in the Whispering Wood. Tion Frey and Willem Lannister were my enemies. Yet now I have to kill my dead friends’ father for their sakes.</Text>

No more will you or yours bend the knee to the whims of a destructive king that takes what he wants without concern for the people he is responsible for. You will rally your banners and take the fight to your enemy showing off your amazing battle prowess as you win victory after victory.

			<Text>House Lannister of Casterly Rock is one of the Great Houses of Westeros, one of its richest and most powerful families and oldest dynasties. It is also the current royal house of the Seven Kingdoms following the extinction of House Baratheon of King's Landing.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Their lands are in the far west of the continent. Their seat is Casterly Rock, a massive rocky promontory overlooking the Sunset Sea which has had habitations and fortifications built into it over the millennia. They are the Lords Paramount of the Westerlands and Wardens of the West. As the new royal house, they also rule directly over the Crownlands from their seat of the Red Keep in King's Landing, the traditional seat of the royal family. House Lannister's Heraldry consists of a golden lion on a crimson background, and their House words are "Hear me roar!", which is rarely mentioned. Their unofficial motto, which is as well known as the official one, is "A Lannister always pays his debts" - which is used much more often and mostly in negative context, though it can also be used in the original, literal sense.</Text>

The Westerlands are one of the constituent regions of the Seven Kingdoms and House Lannister is one of the Great Houses of the realm. House Lannister rule the region from their seat of Casterly Rock and Tywin also holds the title Lord of Casterly Rock. He is also the Warden of the West. He is a widower with three children, Jaime, Cersei, and Tyrion. Casterly Rock, the Lannisters' ancestral seat of power, is located over a group of highly productive goldmines, which have provided the Lannisters with immense wealth over the years and led to the speculation that Tywin "shits gold."</Text>

			<Text>Tywin married his cousin Joanna Lannister and their first children were the fraternal twins Cersei and Jaime. She died after giving birth to Tyrion, which Tywin has blamed his son for ever since. When Jaime was diagnosed with a learning difficulty by a Maester who predicted that he would never read, Tywin sat with his son for four hours a day until he overcame his problems with transposing letters in his mind, much to Jaime's resentment. Tywin despises and hates his younger son, seeing him as misshapen and perverse. When Tyrion was very young, Jaime set him up with a whore. Jaime posed her as a common girl in distress that they rescued from bandits. Jaime chased the bandits off while Tyrion comforted the girl. They married, but when Tywin found out he was furious and made Jaime reveal the truth. Tywin paid her for every one of his guards to have sex with her and forced Tyrion to watch. Tyrion's hatred of Tywin has been reciprocated since. Nevertheless, all of Tywin's children are in awe of him and heed his counsel. He also took part in the War of the Ninepenny Kings.</Text>

			<Text>Tywin served as Hand of the King to Aerys II Targaryen for twenty years until the Mad King, driven by envy and distrust, rejected Tywin's proposal to marry his daughter Cersei to Prince Rhaegar and made his son Jaime a member of the Kingsguard. As members of the Kingsguard are forbidden to marry, Aerys had effectively robbed Tywin of his heir, which Tywin perceived as a great insult and resigned. During Robert's Rebellion Tywin remained neutral, answering neither the summons of the King nor the calls from the rebels, until the Battle of the Trident, after which it became clear that the rebels would win. Tywin marched with the full power of Casterly Rock to the capital, feigning that he had come to defend it from the rebellion. Aerys' advisors urged the King not to trust Tywin, even Jaime Lannister, who knew his father would never back the losing side in a war.</Text>

			<Text>Nevertheless, on Pycelle's advice, the gates were opened to the Lannister army. Tywin ordered the city to be taken and the royal family eliminated in a quick and efficient manner; as a result the city was sacked and the royal family massacred by Ser Gregor Clegane. Upon seeing Tywin's betrayal, Aerys ordered Jaime to bring him Tywin's head and instructed his royal pyromancer to set King's Landing ablaze. Jaime responded by personally stabbing the Mad King in the back. When Robert Baratheon and Eddard Stark reached the Red Keep, Tywin presented the bodies of the royal family as proof of his allegiance. After the rebellion, Robert Baratheon took the throne and married Tywin's daughter Cersei to cement the alliance between their houses.</Text>

			<Text>When they were children, Cersei and her twin-brother, Jaime, looked so alike not even their father, Tywin, could tell them apart. As adults, they still significantly resemble each other. Cersei is a strikingly beautiful woman, with golden hair, emerald green eyes, fair skin, and a slender, graceful figure.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Cersei is willful, ambitious and has a certain low cunning. She is hungry and greedy for power. Cersei believes herself to be subtle and politically astute. She hates being excluded from power on account of her gender, and resents the customs and conventions put on her because she is female. She thinks of herself as a female version of her father, and feels slighted when people do not obey her commands as they would have done for Lord Tywin, but instead give her their counsel, or disagree with her, which she faults on her gender.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Cersei is impatient, and never forgets a slight, whether real or imagined. She considers caution to be cowardice and disagreement for defiance. Her quick temper and her easily wounded pride frequently lead her to make rash decisions, and she rarely considers what unintended consequences her actions might have. She does not shy away from using sex as a weapon.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Early life[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Cersei was born in 266 AC as the first-born child and only daughter to Ser Tywin Lannister, heir to Casterly Rock, and his wife, Lady Joanna. Cersei was born shortly before her twin brother Jaime, who was holding her foot. King Aerys II Targaryen sent the twins their weights in gold as a name day gift, and commanded Tywin to bring the children to court when they were old enough to travel. It is currently unknown whether this visit to King's Landing actually occured, as the royal court came to Casterly Rock following the death of Lord Tytos Lannister in 276 AC. Cersei and Jaime did visit King's Landing in 272 AC, when their mother brought them from Casterly Rock for the Anniversary Tourney held to celebrate the tenth year of King Aerys's reign.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]During their early childhood, Cersei and Jaime were inseparable. They looked so similar as children, up to the point that not even their father was able to keep them apart. Because of their similar looks, Cersei occasionally wore Jaime’s clothes and took lessons from the master-at-arms in his stead, without anyone realizing. They played in the bowels of Casterly Rock, where the caged lions of Cersei's late grandfather, Tytos, were kept. Cersei and Jaime would dare each other to climb into the cage. Cersei once dared to go as far as touch one of the lions, until her brother pulled her away. Cersei and Jaime slept together in the same bed when they were very young, and experimented together in a sexual manner at a young age. During one of these encounters, they were caught by a servant who informed their mother. A guard was placed near Cersei's bedchamber, whilst Jaime's bedchamber was moved to the other side of the castle. The twins were told never to do anything like that ever again, as Joanna would otherwise be forced to tell their father.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Cersei's mother died not long thereafter, in 273 AC, when giving birth to Cersei's younger brother, Tyrion. For killing her mother, Cersei despised her youngest sibling. Shortly after Joanna's death, the Princess of Dorne visited Casterly Rock with her two youngest children, Elia and Oberyn Martell. Though Tyrion was kept out of sight during the visit of the Martells, Cersei promised Princess Elia to show Tyrion to her. Threatening her brother's wet nurse before sending her away, Cersei undid Tyrion's swaddling clothes and hurt her little brother, until Jaime stopped her. The Princess of Dorne proposed a betrothal between Cersei and Oberyn, during this visit, but she was refused, and Tywin informed her that Cersei was meant as a bride for Prince Rhaegar Targaryen.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Attempted betrothal to Rhaegar Targaryen[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Lord Tywin Lannister first informed Cersei of his wish to betroth her to the crown prince when she was no older than six or seven, though he told her never to speak of it until a betrothal was officially announced. Cersei drew a picture of her and Rhaegar on a dragon, once, though she claimed it depicted King Jaehaerys I Targaryen and his sister-wife, Alysanne, when Jaime discovered it. At the age of ten in 276 AC, Cersei became infatuated with Rhaegar after meeting him for the first time during the tournament in honor of Viserys's birth at Lannisport. Before the tourney began Cersei's aunt, Lady Genna, informed Cersei that her betrothal to Rhaegar would be announced during the final feast of the tourney.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]After being separated from Jaime following their mother's discovery of their sexual experimenting, Cersei had numerous bedmaids and companions, daughters of Tywin's bannermen and household knights who were of an age with her. While Cersei occasionally appreciated their company, she had not liked any of them, believing them weak and convinced they were trying to come between her and Jaime. Following Genna's announcement that Cersei's betrothal to Rhaegar would soon be announced, Cersei brought Melara Hetherspoon and Jeyne Farman to a woods witch, Maggy the Frog. After Jeyne fled out of fear, Cersei inquired as to when she and Rhaegar would wed and how many children they would have. Maggy correctly predicted Cersei's marriage with the king and the amount of children both would have. She went on to prophesy that Cersei would outlive her children, who would die as kings and queens, and that after everything she had was taken away by a younger and more beautiful queen, the valonqar would come to end her life. Melara suggested that if they never spoke about it, the prophecies would not come true. However, Melara died shortly after their visit to Maggy, and it is implied that Cersei killed the girl to prevent her from speaking of the prophecies.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]After Melara's death, Cersei inquired with her septa, Saranella, about the meaning of valonqar, who informed her it was High Valyrian for "little brother". Cersei eventually became convinced that Tyrion was the valonqar Maggy spoke of, resulting in her despising and mistrusting him even more than she had before. The prophecy of the valonqar has continued to haunt Cersei.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]After the guests left the westerlands, Cersei learned from her aunt that Tywin had proposed the betrothal to King Aerys II Targaryen, but Aerys refused Cersei as a bride for his son and heir.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Living at court[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]At the age of twelve, following the failure of Lord Steffon Baratheon's mission to find Prince Rhaegar Targaryen a suitable bride in Essos, Cersei was taken to King's Landing by her father, who still served as Hand of the King. In the following years, Lord Tywin Lannister refused every offer of marriage for Cersei. According to Jaime, Tywin still had his sights set on a Targaryen match, either hoping to betroth Cersei to young Prince Viserys or hoping for Rhaegar's new bride, Elia Martell, to die in childbirth.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In 281 AC, when Cersei was fifteen, Jaime visited King's Landing after receiving his knighthood. Cersei informed him their father had been discussing betrothing Jaime to Lysa Tully. Cersei seduced Jaime and persuaded him to join the Kingsguard, which would require him to remain unmarried and live near her in King's Landing. Cersei knew that Tywin would be opposed to the idea, but that he could not openly object to, and offered to make the arrangements herself. However, she had no idea how much the relationship between her father and the king had deteriorated, and although she was successful in securing Jaime's place in the Kingsguard, her plan backfired when Tywin perceived Jaime's appointment to the Kingsguard as a slight by King Aerys intended to rob him of his heir. Furiously, he resigned as Hand, and moved back to Casterly Rock with Cersei, separating the twins once more.</Text>

			<Text>Marriage[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]After the conclusion of Robert's Rebellion, a marriage was arranged between Cersei and the new king, Robert I Baratheon, in order to seal the new royal house's alliance with House Lannister. Cersei and Robert were wed in 284 AC. She and Jaime had sex the morning of her wedding. Nonetheless, Cersei was at first enthralled by the happy crowds at the royal wedding. However, her enthusiasm for the match ended when Robert called her "Lyanna" during their first night together.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The marriage rapidly deteriorated, and Cersei resumed her incestuous relationship with Jaime. She bore him three children (Joffrey, Myrcella and Tommen), all of whom she successfully passed off as Robert's trueborn heirs. Although the king was away during the births of his children, Jaime was present for at least Joffrey's birth, though Cersei refused to let her brother hold the child, fearing people might start to suspect his true parentage. On one occasion, early in her marriage, Cersei became pregnant by Robert. Unwilling to give birth to Robert's child, she sent Jaime out to find a woman to cleanse her. Having grown to resent Robert over the years, Cersei took further care to ensure he did not impregnate her.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]During the early years of their marriage, Cersei declined Robert's invitations to hunt with him, as Robert's trips allowed her more time with Jaime. Because two of Robert's Estermont uncles from Greenstone had remained at court for half a year following Cersei's marriage, Robert insisted on repaying the visit, and Cersei and Jaime accompanied him for a two-week stay at Estermont. While there, Cersei suspected that Robert was sleeping with a cousin of his, and had Jaime follow Robert to confirms her suspicions. Cersei and Jaime slept together on Greenstone, and Cersei likes to believe that was the night their eldest son Joffrey was conceived.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]While Robert "claimed his rights" frequently during the early years of their marriage, his drinking led to him hurting Cersei during those encounters. When she confronted him once during their first year of marriage, Robert claimed it was because of the drink, and he was not to blame. When he tried to take another horn of ale, Cersei smashed her own horn in his face, chipping his tooth. Robert claimed not to remember anything of those nights, but Cersei believes otherwise, and is certain that Robert did recall what he did to her, but felt that pretending to forget was easier than facing the truth. Cersei, in turn, tried to pretend that Robert was Rhaegar during those years. Over time, Robert came to Cersei's bed less frequently, not even once a year.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]True to Maggy's prophecy, Cersei had three children, while Robert sired several bastards. After Joffrey assaulted a pregnant cat, Robert suggested bringing a bastard daughter of his to court. Cersei threatened the girl, claiming King's Landing was a dangerous place for a girl growing up. Though Robert hit Cersei for that, the girl was not brought to court, and all of Robert's bastards were kept out of sight. According to Petyr Baelish, however, there are rumors that Robert fathered twins on a serving woman at Casterly Rock in 295 AC, and that Cersei had the babes killed and the mother sold to a slaver.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Eventually Stannis Baratheon, familiar with the appearance of his brother Robert's black-haired, blue-eyed bastard offspring, grew suspicious of the royal children's lack of resemblance to their supposed father. He confided in Jon Arryn, the Hand of the King, and the two investigated the matter together. After the tourney on Prince Joffrey's name day, Cersei and her children travelled with Lord Tywin to Casterly Rock. During the fortnight following the tourney, Jon was poisoned and fell ill, eventually dying before he could act. While Cersei was innocent of the fact, Stannis was convinced that she was responsible for Jon's death, and he fled to Dragonstone.</Text>

			<Text>House Baratheon was founded by Orys Baratheon, a general in the army of King Aegon I Targaryen, the Conqueror. Orys Baratheon was also rumored to be Aegon's bastard half-brother. He defeated Argilac the Arrogant, the last of the Storm Kings, and captured his castle of Storm's End. For his accomplishments, Orys was made Lord of Storm's End and founder of House Baratheon. Orys took the sigil and words of the defeated House Durrandon as his own. He also took Argilac's daughter, as his wife.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Robert's Rebellion[NEWLINE]Two hundred and eighty-one years later, Lord Robert Baratheon rebelled against King Aerys II Targaryen, the Mad King, when the latter's son, Prince Rhaegar, kidnapped Robert's betrothed, Lyanna Stark, and his father the Mad King murdered her father and brother. House Baratheon, allied to the Houses Stark, Arryn and Tully, defeated the Targaryen army at the Battle of the Trident, while the forces of House Lannister captured King's Landing, where Jaime Lannister slew the Mad King. It was decided that Robert, as the military leader of the rebellion and also the one with the best blood-claim to the Iron Throne, would become King. With Lyanna dead, he married Cersei Lannister to cement the alliance that brought down the Targaryens, but they did not have a happy marriage, due to Robert's whoring and abuse, and Cersei's hatred of him.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Royal House[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]When House Baratheon became the new royal dynasty, the House's heraldry was slightly altered, adding a crown to the black stag on a gold field.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]With Robert Baratheon leaving for King's Landing to rule all of the Seven Kingdoms from the Iron Throne, he left his youngest brother Renly Baratheon, who was only a child at the time, to rule the seat of House Baratheon at Storm's End. Meanwhile, he appointed his middle brother Stannis Baratheon as Lord of Dragonstone island, the ancestral seat of House Targaryen. This also made Stannis the lord of several minor outlying islands of the Crownlands which were in Blackwater Bay. Many saw this as an insult to Stannis, as windswept and isolated Dragonstone was not as wealthy or prestigious as Storm's End, the capital of the Stormlands. However, Stannis was a proven military commander and a loyal vassal of his experience was needed to rein in Dragonstone, where many of the most die-hard Targaryen loyalist Houses were located.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It isn't exactly clear how King Robert envisioned dividing up his possessions for future generations of House Baratheon, or if he even had a plan. It isn't clear if he meant to permanently unite the Crownlands around King's Landing with the Stormlands around Storm's End (which do border the Crownlands). Alternatively, he might have handed off Storm's End and the Stormlands to a cadet branch of House Baratheon formed by Stannis or Renly's children, while Robert's own "children" ruled the Crownlands. There's even the possibility that Robert intended to cut his younger brothers out of the succession entirely, and have the rule of the Stormlands pass to his younger "son" Tommen. Whatever plans Robert may have had were swept away by the outbreak of war upon his unexpected death.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]War of the Five Kings[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Seventeen years after he was crowned king, Robert Baratheon died of a wound taken on a boar hunt. Secretly, his death was actually the result of Queen Cersei having his wine spiked to make sure he would be too drunk to defend himself on the hunt.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]His eldest son, Joffrey Baratheon, was crowned King of the Andals and the First Men, but his rule was soon contested by those who realized that he was actually born of incest between Queen Cersei and her twin brother, Jaime, including both of Robert's brothers. This directly led to the outbreak of the conflict which would become known as the War of the Five Kings. Just as the war tore apart the Seven Kingdoms into different factions following different kings, in microcosm, House Baratheon itself has been torn between three rival heirs claiming the succession:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Joffrey Baratheon, holding the Iron Throne, continued to rule the cadet branch of House Baratheon formed by King Robert, "House Baratheon of King's Landing". However, with the spread of rumors revealing that Joffrey is not Robert's son but a bastard of incest between Cersei and Jaime Lannister, none of the lords of the Stormlands declared for him.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Stannis Baratheon formed his own cadet branch, "House Baratheon of Dragonstone", and claimed the kingship as Robert's eldest surviving brother and thus legal heir. Robert had several bastard children but by definition none of them could inherit his rule. However, as an unpopular and stern man, hardly any of the Houses from the Stormlands declared for Stannis.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Flouting tradition, Robert's younger brother Renly Baratheon declared himself king ahead of his older brother Stannis, knowingly ignoring the laws of succession that made him Stannis's heir. Almost all of the lords of Houses in the Stormlands declared for Renly, who also continued to hold Storm's End itself. As a further insult to Stannis, Renly didn't even bother officially forming his own cadet branch, instead claiming dominion over all of "House Baratheon". To strengthen his military and political position, Renly entered into a marriage-alliance with the powerful House Tyrell of the Reach, by wedding Margaery Tyrell. For his personal sigil, and the sigil of his faction in the war, Renly altered the original color scheme of the sigil of House Baratheon. Instead of the black crowned stag on a yellow field, Renly's banner displayed a golden crowned stag on a field of green, a nod to the color scheme of his new wife's powerful family, House Tyrell.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Renly was subsequently assassinated and left no heirs. Had he lived Renly might have gained the support of House Stark as both houses were holding talks prior to Renly's death. All of the noble Houses of the Stormlands that had declared for Renly then grudgingly switched their allegiance to Stannis as the only surviving Baratheon brother, while the Tyrells abandoned them claiming (accurately) that Stannis had something to do with Renly's death. Some of the Tyrell vassals, such as House Florent, went over to Stannis. Stannis assembled his new armies into a massive assault in King's Landing, the Battle of the Blackwater. However, Stannis' forces were crushed in the assault by the timely arrival of Tywin Lannister and Loras Tyrell, heralding the new Lannister-Tyrell alliance. Most of the military strength of the Stormlands was crushed in the battle, though Stannis himself was able to escape back to Dragonstone with a handful of remaining troops. Stannis lost most of the Stormlands as a result of the battle: with their military strength spent, the Houses of the Stormlands were too weak to resist Joffrey's armies and bent the knee. Some of Renly's old supporters who were never fond of Stannis even actively switched to Joffrey's side.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]At this point, in terms of the family, there is no unified "House Baratheon" as there was before the war. Stannis is indeed the legal heir of the previous House, but he has formed his own cadet branch with new heraldry. Joffrey, along with his younger sister Myrcella and younger brother Tommen, were all bastards and not actual "Baratheons". Aside from being a bastard, Joffrey also led his own cadet branch with different heraldry, not the original "House Baratheon". Thus the only surviving members of the Baratheon family were Stannis and his daughter Shireen. Shireen and Stannis were later killed during the war, however, extinguishing the true Baratheon bloodline - though Robert left behind several bastard children, of which at least Gendry is still alive.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In terms of "House Baratheon", the political entity ruling over the Stormlands, they have been largely crushed and subdued by the Iron Throne forces.</Text>

			<Text>Robert was the first son of Steffon Baratheon and Cassana Baratheon, and has two younger brothers, Renly and Stannis. Steffon was the head of House Baratheon and Lord Paramount of the Stormlands. The Stormlands are one of the constituent regions of the Seven Kingdoms and House Baratheon is one of the Great Houses of the realm. His parents died in his youth when their ship was caught in a storm; Robert, standing on the walls of Storm's End with Stannis, witnessed his parents ship that was returning from Essos break up on the rocks. He inherited the lordship, and was fostered by Jon Arryn, the head of House Arryn, another Great House. Eddard Stark, the second son of House Stark, was also fostered by Jon Arryn and Robert and Eddard became as close as brothers. Robert served King Aerys II Targaryen (known as the Mad King) as the Lord Paramount of the Stormlands. Robert was betrothed to Lyanna Stark, Eddard's sister. At the time of their betrothal, Robert bet Richard Lonmouth during the tourney at Harrenhal.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]However, Lyanna was alleged kidnapped by Rhaegar Targaryen. The Mad King had Eddard's father and brother killed for protesting against the kidnapping. Their deaths sparked a massive uprising against Aerys led by Robert, Eddard and Jon Arryn. Lyanna and Aerys died during the civil war that followed. Robert claimed the Iron Throne because he started the war and killed Prince Rhaegar personally. Robert also had the best claim to the throne as a result of being related to the Targaryens through his mother. The other leaders of the rebels, Jon Arryn and Eddard Stark, believed that Robert, with his claim and charismatic personality, should be king and both stood aside. However, due to Tywin Lannister brutally sacking King's Landing and Gregor Clegane murdering Elia Martell and her two children with Rhaegar in cold blood, Robert and Eddard briefly fell out over Eddard's pleas for Tywin and Gregor to answer for their war crimes.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Robert was devastated by Lyanna's death, but was urged by Jon Arryn to marry Cersei of House Lannister, making an alliance with her father, Tywin Lannister, who had joined his cause late in the conflict and delivered the capital of King's Landing to him. He named Jon Arryn as his Hand while Eddard took his father's role as Warden of the North.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Stannis fought for Robert through the war though the two brothers never loved each other. Robert tells Eddard Stark "You were the brother I chose." Despite Stannis's service during the war, Robert made Renly the Lord of Storm's End following his victory. Renly was only a child during the war, so he did not fight. Stannis was made Lord of Dragonstone and served on Robert's small council as Master of Ships. Renly later joined the small council as Master of Laws.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Robert has been the King of the Andals and the First Men and the ruler of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros since the end of the civil war. However, he was more interested in drinking, whoring and hunting than ruling his kingdom. He revels in the glory days of the rebellion. He leaves running the kingdom largely to his small council, led by Jon Arryn.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]King Robert also loves to throw events such as tournaments at which he spares no expense. Unfortunately, after seventeen years Robert's excesses have left the realm deeply in debt for a shocking six million Gold Dragons, half to House Lannister. He apparently has three children with Cersei: Joffrey, Myrcella and Tommen. Unbeknownst to Robert, all three were actually fathered by Cersei's twin brother Jaime Lannister. Robert has also fathered several illegitimate bastards, to whom he pays no attention. He has an unacknowledged bastard son named Gendry fathered on a tavern wench. He has an unacknowledged bastard daughter named Barra fathered on the prostitute Mhaegen. He has at least four other unacknowledged bastards fathered with various women in the city of King's Landing alone.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Jon Arryn began investigating the lineage of Cersei's children, comparing their appearance to Robert's bastard offspring. He died under mysterious circumstances shortly after beginning his investigation. Robert has decided to ride north to Eddard's keep Winterfell to name him as Jon Arryn's replacement.</Text>

			<Text>Stannis is the second-born son of Steffon Baratheon and Cassana Baratheon, the younger brother of the late King Robert Baratheon and older brother of Renly Baratheon. Steffon was the head of House Baratheon and Lord Paramount of the Stormlands. The Stormlands are one of the constituent regions of the Seven Kingdoms and House Baratheon is one of the Great Houses of the realm. Steffon died when the boys were young and Robert inherited his titles. Stannis is a serious and severe man.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Robert led a rebellion against King Aerys II Targaryen, deposing and replacing him as the ruler of the Seven Kingdoms. Stannis fought for Robert during the war. He was besieged at Storm's End for much of the conflict. He was rescued from starvation by the smuggler Davos, who brought a ship full of onions into the castle. Stannis knighted Davos as a reward but also punished him for his smuggling by cutting four finger tips from his right hand. Davos is fiercely loyal to Stannis and saw his punishment as just. Davos's son Matthos served Stannis as a scribe. Stannis went on to conquer Dragonstone, the seat of House Targaryen. During the Greyjoy Rebellion, Stannis destroyed the Greyjoy fleet.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Stannis and Robert never loved one another. Despite Stannis's service during the war, Robert made their infant brother Renly (who was too young to have fought in the war) Lord of Storm's End following his victory, which Stannis took as an affront. Stannis was made Lord of Dragonstone and served on his brother's small council as Master of Ships. Though not outright cruel or malicious, he is a stern and humorless man, making him the least popular of the Baratheon brothers.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]He married Selyse Florent. They have a loveless marriage; Stannis regards her as sickly and resents her failure to bear him a son. During the first season Stannis is on Dragonstone for an extended stay, preferring the solitude of the island.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]He has converted to the Lord of Light under the influence of the priestess Melisandre. His household have largely followed his conversion.] He has adopted the flaming red heart of the Lord of Light with the stag of Baratheon in the middle as his sigil.</Text>

			<Text>Appearance and Character[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Renly is a handsome and charismatic man, winning friends easily, but he also strikes some people as frivolous. Renly enjoys tournaments and hunting but is not driven by the passion for food, drink, or wenching, as Robert I Baratheon came to be. He is quite popular with the smallfolk due to his good looks, friendly ways and charisma.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Renly is twenty-one years old, a tall man with black hair falling to his shoulders. He is thought to look eerily similar to a young Robert, though several inches shorter, and far less muscular. In A Game of Thrones he is said to wear green to match his eyes, but in A Clash of Kings he is described as having blue eyes like Robert. His suit of enameled green armor with a helm adorned with a pair of golden antlers was made by Tobho Mott. Renly keeps his body trim and his thick, jet-black hair long but always neatly combed. He prefers to be clean-shaven.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Unbeknownst to the realm at large, and despite the many women who are attracted to him, Renly is homosexual. According to his lover, Ser Loras Tyrell, Renly disdains book learning, believing that books should only be read by maesters. Despite this, he owns books with "drawings that would turn a septon blind", implying some kind of pornography.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]History[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Born in 277 AC, Renly was the youngest of the three sons of Lord Steffon Baratheon and Lady Cassana Estermont.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Renly grew up at Storm's End. Only a boy of six at the time of Robert's Rebellion, he spent the war under siege in Storm's End, together with his older brother, Stannis, where he was witness to the desperation of the starving garrison.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As a boy, Renly loved bright colors and fabrics. He loved games as well, and would run laughing through the halls of Storm's End.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]By his older brother Robert, Renly was eventually granted the seat of Storm's End and named Lord Paramount of the Stormlands, upsetting Stannis, who felt that, as the elder of the two, Storm's End was his by right.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]When Renly turned sixteen, he made a lord's progress across the stormlands to mark his coming of age. During this progress, he also visited the isle of Tarth, where Renly courteously danced with Brienne of Tarth.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Princess Arianne Martell recalls that Renly also visited Sunspear once. She had tried her best to seduce Renly, but remembers that he had seemed more bemused than inflamed by her attempts.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]During his time as Lord of Storm's End, Renly took Loras Tyrell as his page and squire. This was likely the start of their clandestine love affair. Although not widely known, their forbidden relationship is known to various others at court.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Renly was eventually named to the small council, where he occupied the position of master of laws. While he is at court, his castellan at Storm's End is Ser Cortnay Penrose, who raises King Robert's bastard son, Edric Storm, for them. Brella runs Renly's household in King's Landing for him.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Recent Events[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]While King Robert I Baratheon's procession is returning from Winterfell, Renly meets up with them, accompanied by Ser Barristan Selmy, Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, and the King's Justice, Ser Ilyn Payne. Deeply amused by Prince Joffrey Baratheon's accusations against Arya Stark's direwolf Nymeria, Renly is forced to leave the room at Darry, laughing at the thought of Joffrey being disarmed and beaten by a girl smaller and younger than him.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Renly performs well in the Hand's tourney, losing to the Hound, Sandor Clegane. Renly shows Lord Eddard Stark a painted portrait of Margaery Tyrell and asks if she looks like Lyanna Stark; Eddard is puzzled by this but states the girl looks nothing like his late sister Lyanna. Renly and Ser Loras Tyrell want Robert to take Loras's sister, Margaery, as his new queen and they think if Margaery looks like Lyanna it would make the plan easier.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]While Robert lies dying after being wounded in the kingswood, Renly approaches Eddard and suggests they seize control of the royal children before Queen Cersei Lannister can strike. Eddard refuses the offer, and Renly flees King's Landing along with Loras.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]After Robert's death, Renly manages to win the support of powerful House Tyrell and many of their bannermen through a secret love affair with Loras and a marriage to his sister Margaery. Renly is crowned Lord of the Seven Kingdoms at Highgarden.</Text>

Half of them are like to come over to me before the battle starts. You have fewer than four hundred horse, my scouts tell me-freeriders in boiled leather who will not stand an instant against armored lances.

			<Text>Appearance and Character[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Joffrey has the Lannister look and is tall for a boy his age, with blond curly hair. Known to be handsome, he has bright green eyes, pouty lips and an evil sneer. Jon Snow thinks that Joffrey looks like a girl. He always wears the finest clothing and accents, as befits the royal heir. His surcout is divided, showing both the Baratheon stag of his father, King Robert I, and the Lannister lion of his mother, Cersei. Joffrey is a skilled dancer.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Twelve years old at the beginning of A Song of Ice and Fire, Joffrey was strong-willed as a child and has an uncontrollable temper not unlike Cersei and an unchecked sadistic streak. He has little sense of right or wrong, which often leads him to trouble, especially when he loses his temper. When things go wrong, he always blames the problems on others. Despite being willful he is reckless, vicious, cruel and not very intelligent, all of which combine to make him prone to irrational and bad judgements.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]History[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Joffrey grew up as a spoiled and indulgent child with a cruel streak within him. His father, King Robert I Baratheon, is deeply disappointed with his son and feels little affection for Joffrey – nor did he like the fact that Joffrey would always cry whenever Robert picked him up. It is implied that Joffrey craves Robert's respect and approval, and many of his acts are done in an effort to live up to his father's standards.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Once after learning a kitchen cat was pregnant, Joffrey killed the animal and cut open its belly to see the kittens inside. He showed one of the unborn kittens to his father. Robert was so shocked and angry he hit the boy so hard it knocked out two of his baby teeth. Cersei also remarks that Robert would have beaten the boy if she had allowed it. It is also implied Joffrey bullied his younger brother, Tommen.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Queen Cersei Lannister assigned Sandor Clegane to be her son's sworn sword. While Sandor is widely known as the Hound, Joffrey refers to his guardian as "dog".[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]For Joffrey's twelfth name day, King Robert organized a tourney in King's Landing in 298 AC, where, amongst others, Lord Walder Frey, Lord Jon Arryn, Lord Stannis Baratheon, and Ser Davos Seaworth were present. Following the tourney, Joffrey and his siblings traveled with Cersei to Casterly Rock with their grandfather, Lord Tywin Lannister.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Recent Events[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Joffrey and the rest of the royal family take the kingsroad to Winterfell after Lord Jon Arryn's death, as King Robert I Baratheon asks Lord Eddard Stark to become the new Hand of the King. Joffrey begins to court the pretty Sansa Stark, Eddard's daughter, to whom the prince is betrothed. Joffrey spars with Robb Stark in the yard and insults him. After Bran Stark is critically injured after falling from a tower, Joffrey's uncle, Tyrion Lannister, slaps Joffrey for speaking rudely of the boy's condition. Tyrion is later blamed when an assassin with a Valyrian steel dagger fails in an attempt to murder the comatose Bran, which furthers the growing enmity between Houses Stark and Lannister.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]On the way from Winterfell to King's Landing, Joffrey spends a day riding with Sansa, who enjoys it greatly whilst he drinks wine. They come upon Arya Stark and her friend Mycah, the butcher's boy, practicing sword fighting. Joffrey is drunk and commands Mycah to spar with him; Mycah does not take up the challenge, and Joffrey pricks him with his sword, Lion's Tooth, ignoring pleas to leave him alone. Arya smacks him with the stick, allowing Mycah to escape; an enraged Joffrey slashes at Arya and is injured when her direwolf, Nymeria, protects her. Arya takes Lion's Tooth from him and hurls it towards the Trident. The humiliated youth later claims before Robert's court at Darry that he had been attacked by Mycah and Nymeria. This results in the deaths of Mycah and Sansa's direwolf, Lady, and earns Joffrey the hatred of Arya. Robert's younger brother, Lord Renly Baratheon, openly laughs at his nephew for being beaten and disarmed by a girl younger than him.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]While drinking with Eddard Stark at the Hand's tourney at King's Landing, King Robert openly despairs of his son and heir, revealing to his old friend that he has often thought of abdicating; the only thing that stops him is the thought of Joffrey sitting on the Iron Throne with his mother Cersei whispering in his ear.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Acting as the new Hand, Ned Stark discovers that Joffrey, along with his siblings, are actually bastards born of incest between Cersei and her twin, Ser Jaime of Robert's Kingsguard. Robert never questioned the boy's parentage. Cersei protects her children's secret by arranging for King Robert's death after drunkenly hunting in the kingswood.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Following Robert's death, Joffery summons the council and commands that they make arrangements for his coronation as Lord of the Seven Kingdoms. When Ned produces Robert's will, which declares Ned regent and mentions "the heir" rather than specifying Joffrey as heir to the Iron Throne, Cersei tears it up and advises Ned to swear fealty to her son. Ned in turn reveals that Joffrey has no claim to the throne and that his uncle, Lord Stannis Baratheon, is the true heir, but Eddard is quickly arrested for treason.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]After taking the Iron Throne as Robert's heir, Joffrey starts his first court session by naming his grandfather, Lord Tywin Lannister, as the new Hand of the King, appointing his mother to the small council and Jaime Lannister as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, and dismissing the legendary knight Barristan Selmy from his service, against all traditions. When Barristan the Bold storms out in disgust, making a remark about the ease with which Stannis would take the throne from him, Joffrey orders Barristan seized and questioned, though the old knight escapes. The vacancy on the Kingsguard is filled by Joffrey's sworn shield, Sandor Clegane, who is called the Hound.</Text>

			<Text>Kingdom of the Reach[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Tyrells trace their line of descent through the female line to the legendary Garth the Gardener, the mythical first King of the Reach reigning in the Age of Heroes, and the son of the equally mythic Garth Greenhand. Unlike other Great Houses, the Tyrells never ruled as kings. The Tyrells were stewards to House Gardener, the ancient ruling line of the Kings of the Reach, who periodically intermarried with lower ranking houses of the Reach such as House Tyrell or House Florent.[5][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Ser Alester Tyrell, the founder of the house, was an Andal knight and adventurer who showed such prowess at arms that he was named the champion and sword shield of King Gwayne V Gardener, the last of the Three Sage Kings. Ser Alester's eldest son also became a notable knight, but died in a tourney. Alester's second son, Gareth, was of a more bookish bent and never achieved knighthood, choosing instead to serve as a royal steward. He and his son Leo performed their duties so well, the Gardeners made the office of High Steward hereditary. It is from Gareth that today’s Tyrells descend.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]During the minority of King Garland VI Gardener, a member of House Tyrell ruled the Reach in his name as Regent.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]When Lords Manderly and Peake instigated a civil war to see their respective wives, both daughters to the senile old King Garth X Gardener, succeed as Queen of the Reach, Ser Osmund Tyrell, the High Steward of Highgarden, led an alliance of twoscore houses to put down the rebels and reclaimed the ruins of Highgarden which had been sacked by a Dornish king and his raiders. Ser Osmund placed a second cousin of the late Garth X, who has been killed by the raiders, upon the new throne as King Mern VI Gardener.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Relying on the able counsel of Ser Osmund, and later Osmund's son Ser Robert Tyrell, and finally Robert's son Lorent Tyrell, King Mern ruled well, rebuilding Highgarden and doing much and more to restore the power of the Reach and House Gardener. Mern VI was so pleased with them that he gave Ser Robert the hand of his youngest daughter in marriage, thereby allowing the following generations of Tyrells to claim decent from Garth Greenhand. That was the first marriage between the two houses, and nine more unions followed in the passing centuries.[5][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Targaryen Era[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Following the defeat and death of King Mern IX Gardener and his other kin, at the Field of Fire during the War of Conquest, Harlen Tyrell, hereditary high steward of the Reach, surrendered Highgarden and was granted the castle along with dominion of the Reach as Lord Paramount of the Mander by Aegon the Conqueror. As Wardens of the South they frequently warred with the Dornishmen, who remained independent. Harlen disappeared in the Dornish sands during the First Dornish War.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]During the reign of King Jaehaerys I Targaryen, the Tyrells hosted the famed Tourney of the Field of Roses.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As the Dance of the Dragons began, Lord Lyonel Tyrell was an infant, and his regent mother was judged likely to align the Reach with the House's "overmighty" bannermen, the Hightowers, and the greens. However, House Tyrell decided to take no part in the war. The Tyrell bannermen, on the other hand, were split during the war, with men of the Reach fighting on both sides. Later Ser Ulf the White would attempt to claim Highgarden for himself, as House Tyrell had taken no part in the Dance and he believed they should be considered traitors.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]When Daeron I Targaryen, the Young Dragon, attempted the conquest of Dorne, Lord Lyonel commanded the army that invaded via Prince's Pass. After the initial victory, Daeron appointed Lord Tyrell as governor of Dorne. Lord Tyrell liked Dornish women and one night he pulled the rope that would signal for a wench to come to his bed, and a hundred scorpions fell from the canopy instead. His death sparked new revolts, and the conquest was undone in a fortnight.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Lord Leo "Longthorn" Tyrell participated in the tourney at Ashford Meadow, beginning the tourney as one of the champions. Both Prince Aegon Targaryen and Ser Duncan recognized him as a formidable opponent, one that Duncan would better avoid.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]During Robert's Rebellion, House Tyrell stayed loyal to King Aerys II Targaryen. Lord Mace Tyrell's forces achieved victory against Robert Baratheon at the Battle of Ashford, dealing the future king his only defeat of the war at the cost of Ser Quentin Tyrell's life. Mace likes to take credit for the success, but it was the van under command of Lord Randyll Tarly that put Robert to flight. Mace went on to besiege Robert's brother Stannis at Storm's End, but bent the knee after the Targaryens were all but wiped out in the Sack of King's Landing. Robert Baratheon, king by conquest, forgave them and accepted them as sworn vassals.</Text>

			<Text>House Greyjoy of Pyke is one of the Great Houses of Westeros. It rules over the Iron Islands, a harsh and bleak collection of forbidding islands off the west coast of Westeros, from the Seastone Chair in the castle of Pyke on the island of the same name. The head of the family is traditionally known as the Lord Reaper of Pyke. Their sigil is a golden kraken on a black field, and their house motto is "We Do Not Sow." Members of the family tend to be attractive and well-built, with black hair.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Greyjoys of Pyke claim descent from the Grey King of the Age of Heroes. Legend says the Grey King ruled not only the western isles but the sea itself, and took a mermaid to wife.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In the era when the ironborn chose their rulers through the kingsmoot, only Houses Greyiron and Goodbrother produced more kings than the Greyjoys. For instance, the Old Kraken, Loron Greyjoy, was chosen as a King of the Iron Islands in a kingsmoot. The iron lords, including the Greyjoys, intermarried with the victorious Andals when they invaded the Iron Isles.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Come the Wars of Conquest, King Harren the Black of House Hoare ruled all the lands between the mountains, from the Neck to the Blackwater Rush. When Harren and his sons perished in the burning of Harrenhal, Aegon Targaryen granted the riverlands to Edmyn Tully of House Tully. The surviving lords of the Iron Islands fell into chaotic squabbling, leading Aegon to invade the islands to subdue them. After they bent the knee Aegon allowed them to revive their ancient custom and chose who should have the primacy among them. They chose Lord Vickon Greyjoy of Pyke.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Thus relegated to their dismal homeland and constrained by the king's peace, the Greyjoys have kept themselves distant from the other Great Houses, rarely taking part in events on the mainland (which they call the "green lands"), even when asked.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]At various times the Greyjoys have tried to return to their ancient practices of raiding the western coastlines. At the beginning of the Dance of the Dragons, the Lord Reaper of Pyke, Dalton Greyjoy, was offered the position of master of ships to replace Ser Tyland Lannister, who had been made master of coin of King Aegon II Targaryen. Dalton, the Red Kraken, instead sacked Lannisport and sent the ironborn to raid the coasts, capturing Kayce and Faircastle on Fair Isle. Dalton defied the Iron Throne for two years, but he was eventually murdered in Faircastle.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Lord Dagon and the ironmen later raided the coastal areas of Westeros, sacking the town of Little Dosk. Lord Beron Stark gathered swords and House Lannister built ships in an effort to drive Lord Dagon and his ironmen back to the Iron Islands, and Dagon was ultimately unable to resist the Targaryens.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Lord Quellon Greyjoy tried to reform the ironborn and integrate them with the mainland, but he was killed late in Robert's Rebellion. His son, Lord Balon Greyjoy, rejected Quellon's reforms and desired a return to the Old Way. He created the Iron Fleet and led his own rebellion against the Iron Throne, declaring himself King of the Iron Islands, like many of his ancestors. Despite initiating several strong early strikes, such as burning of the Lannister fleet at anchor, he was defeated. Balon's own fleet under the command of his brother Victarion burned and his two eldest sons Rodrik and Maron were slain during the war. His last son Theon was given as a hostage and ward to Lord Eddard Stark after he swore fealty to House Baratheon of King's Landing.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Since their revolt, the Greyjoys have been as insular as ever. With Theon living in the green lands, Lord Balon raised his daughter Asha as his heir. Balon exiled his brother Euron when he raped the salt wife of their brother Victarion, Lord Captain of the Iron Fleet. Victarion was forced to kill his wife to retain his honor. Since then Euron has sailed the world aboard the Silence, reaving and pillaging, unwelcome in the Isles while Balon still lives. Another brother, Aeron Damphair, had been changed by his experience of washing overboard during the Battle of Fair Isle, and became a priest of the Drowned God.</Text>

			<Text>Early life[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Balon is the eldest surviving son of Quellon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands, and a lady of House Sunderly. It is not clear when he was born.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Balon learned to sail when still young and was a very skilled captain. Balon scaled the Flint Cliffs to the Blind Lord's haunted tower when he was ten. By his thirteenth year, he had become an expert oarsman. At fifteen he sailed with Dagmer Cleftjaw to the Stepstones on a reaving, killing his first man and taking his first two salt wives there. By seventeen he captained his own longship. Later he often went raiding and was known for his fierceness and fearlessness.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Balon and two of his brothers, Euron and Victarion, wanted their father Quellon to join Robert's Rebellion. Quellon was peaceful and cautious, however, and desired neutrality. After Crown Prince Rhaegar Targaryen was slain in the Battle of the Trident, Quellon was convinced by his sons to join the rebellion or else gain nothing from the war. The ironmen's contribution to the war turned out to be minimal. Quellon was slain fighting the longships of the Shield Islands in a battle at the Mander, after which Balon brought the Greyjoy ships back to Pyke so he could claim the Seastone Chair.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]When Balon returned to Pyke he found out his younger brother, Urrigon, had died of gangrene after being injured in the finger dance. The maester at Pyke had tried to save the hand of the boy, but his potions had failed and the fourteen-year-old Urrigon lost his life instead. Balon commanded the same treatment be used on the maester, who died along with Balon's stepmother.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Balon is married to Alannys Harlaw, who gave him three sons and a daughter: Rodrik, Maron, Asha, and Theon.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Greyjoy's Rebellion[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Lord Quellon Greyjoy had desired stronger ties with the green lands, forbade most reaving, brought maesters to the Iron Islands, and outlawed the taking of thralls. His son Balon, however, wished to return to the Old Way, which he considered a better way for the ironborn. After becoming Lord of the Iron Islands, Balon reversed most of his father's reforms. Over five years he oversaw the construction of the Iron Fleet to serve the Seastone Chair.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Balon was quick to seize the chance to revert to the ways of old when he thought that King Robert I Baratheon's recently-gained rule, through conquest, was unstable. Believing Robert would not have the support, the men, or the will to resist, Balon launched his own rebellion and declared himself King of the Iron Islands.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The ironborn won early success when they burned the Lannister fleet at Lannisport, but Balon's triumph was short lived. His eldest son, Rodrik, died during the storming of Seagard and his fleet and forces were defeated, while his second son, Maron, died while defending Pyke.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Balon was forced to accept defeat and bent the knee, re-swearing fealty to the Baratheons, allowing his sole surviving son, ten-year-old Theon, to be taken hostage by Lord Eddard Stark to Winterfell. Balon and his wife, Alannys, grew apart after the deaths of Rodrik and Maron and the taking of Theon.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In 297 AC one of Balon's brothers, Euron, seduced the third wife of another brother, Victarion. To prevent bloodshed between the brothers Balon sent Euron into exile and swore he would be killed if he returned. To keep his honor Victarion killed his wife.</Text>

After Quellon was killed in a battle at the Mander, however, the new Lord Balon returned to the Iron Islands with his younger brothers.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]At the outset of Greyjoy's Rebellion, Euron concocted a plan to sail into Lannisport and burn the Lannister fleet at anchor. The Iron Fleet, commanded by Euron's brother Victarion, followed the plan and successfully destroyed the westerlands' naval force.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Some time after the war, in 297 AC, Euron was sent away from the Iron Islands by Lord Balon as punishment for seducing or raping Victarion's salt wife, and he was warned never to return while Balon was alive.

			<Text>Early life[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Doran was the first born child of his parents, and thus heir to his mother, the Princess of Dorne. For years, he was an only child, as his mother had several miscarriages. While he would have four siblings, Mors and Olyvar, both died in the cradle. Doran spent several years of his childhood at the Water Gardens, and by the age of nine, he was a squire to Lord Gargalen at Salt Shore. While there, his mother gave birth to his sister, Elia. As Elia had been born one month premature, Doran was convinced that his sister too would die, as their brothers had done before, but she survived. A year later, Doran's brother Oberyn was born.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As a young man, Doran took a tour through the Free Cities. He visited Volantis, and next went to Norvos, where he met his future wife, Lady Mellario. They fell in love and Mellario returned to Dorne with Doran, where they were betrothed. In 273 AC, when his mother, her consort, and Doran's two younger siblings traveled through the south of Seven Kingdoms on a quest to find suitable matches for Elia and Oberyn, Doran stayed behind as castellan of Sunspear, with Mellario. Although Mellario was high born enough to become his wife, most marriages between nobles in Westeros are political. A love match is very uncommon. In 276 AC, Doran and Mellario's first child, Arianne, was born. Around 279 AC, Doran inherited the rule of Dorne.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]An unknown amount of time after his siblings had travelled to find suitable marriage candidates, Doran's brother Oberyn fought in a duel with Lord Edgar Yronwood. Due to Oberyn's high birth and young age, the two men had agreed to duel until first blood. Both men were injured, but when Oberyn's cuts healed, and Lord Edgar's festered, eventually resulting in his death, it was whispered Oberyn had fought with a poisoned blade. Doran acted swiftly, sending Oberyn in temporary exile.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Prince of Dorne[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Doran's sister Elia Martell was betrothed to Crown Prince Rhaegar Targaryen in early 279 AC, and wed him a year later. She had two young children by Rhaegar, Rhaenys and Aegon. When Rhaegar disappeared with Lyanna Stark in 282 AC, not long after Aegon's birth, it started a chain of events leading to Robert's Rebellion, in which the North, and several houses from the stormlands and Vale (later joined by several houses from the riverlands) fought against the Iron Throne and House Targaryen. Doran was furious about the way Elia had been treated by Rhaegar, and as a consequence was slow to lend any aid to the Targaryens. After Rhaegar returned from the south to King's Landing, Doran agreed to send ten thousand Dornishmen to fight in the loyalist army, under the command of his uncle, Prince Lewyn Martell of the Kingsguard, understanding that Elia, as the wife to the crown prince, would one day become Queen, and that her son Aegon would one day be King.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]However, Rhaegar died at the Battle of the Trident, as did Doran's uncle, Lewyn, and King Aerys II Targaryen, believing that Lewyn had betrayed Rhaegar on the Trident, refused to send Elia and her children to Dragonstone alongside his own wife, Queen Rhaella Targaryen, and their son Viserys. Not long after, during the Sack of King's Landing, Elia and her children were brutally killed by Gregor Clegane and Amory Lorch, men from the Lannister host. The new King, Robert I Baratheon, was accepting of their deaths. As a consequence, Doran's brother Oberyn attempted to raise a rebellion for Viserys during the year after the rebellion, but the new Hand of the King, Lord Jon Arryn, traveled to Sunspear to return Prince Lewyn's bones, and spoke with Doran, ending all talks of rebellion.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Prince Doran Martell holding a half peeled blood orange - by Tommy Arnold[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]However, Doran desired revenge for the deaths of Elia and her children as well, and for this purpose, worked closely together with his brother Oberyn for years, planning on destroying all that Lord Tywin Lannister holds dear, before killing him as well. To this end, Oberyn travelled to Braavos, where Ser Willem Darry had fled to with Viserys and Daenerys Targaryen. A secret pact was made, with Oberyn signing for Dorne, and with the Sealord of Braavos as a witness, betrothing Doran's daughter Arianne to the exiled King Viserys.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Doran also sent his son Quentyn, born in 281 AC, to serve Lord Ormond Yronwood as a page, and later squire. Quentyn's fostering was done to make peace with the Yronwoods, as enmity between the two houses had arisen after the death of Lord Edgar Yronwood. However, this caused another strain on Doran's marriage to Mellario. Although they had married out of love, their marriage had not been very happy. Mellario had not been able to get used to the Dornish customs, which were so different from the Norvoshi customs. As such, Mellario did not approve of Quentyn's fostering, which is not common in Norvoshi culture, believing her son to be much too young at the time. When Doran, after sending Quentyn to Yronwood, planned to send Arianne to Tyrosh to serve as the cupbearer to the Archon of Tyrosh, which would have enabled her to meet her betrothed in secret, Mellario threatened to harm herself, should Doran steal another one of her children. Not wanting to hurt his wife, Doran thus kept Arianne in Dorne. Doran and his wife had a third child, Trystane, who was born in 287 AC. However, Doran and Mellario's marriage continued to detoriate, and she would never forgive Doran for sending Quentyn away. Eventually, she went back to Norvos.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]While he had planned to tell Arianne about her betrothal to the last Targaryen heir when she was sixteen, he decided to keep the secret from her due to her spirited and willful nature. Unbeknownst to Doran, however, Arianne had read a letter Doran had been writing to Quentyn, in which he mentioned that Quentyn would inherit the rule of Dorne from Doran. Thus, she had come to believe that Doran's coolness towards her was due to the fact that he wanted to disinherit her, and name Quentyn his heir instead. When Doran suggests numerous aged suitors to her (including Lord Walder Frey, Ben Beesbury, and Gyles Rosby), whilst declining more age-matched suitors (like Edmure Tully and Willas Tyrell), it only strengthened her beliefs. In truth, Doran had feared that it would be suspicious if he was not seen trying to arrange a betrothal for Arianne, and had only made the suggestions he had because he had known she would reject every single one[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Doran eventually became afflicted with gout. In 298 AC, when still capable of walking, albeitly with a stick, Doran moved from Sunspear to the Water Gardens. Two years later, however, Doran's gout has become far worse, and he is no longer able to walk, but instead is usually confined to a wheelchair. Not wanting his enemies to know how feeble he has grown, he remained at the Water Gardens, where he is far away from curious eyes. At the Water Gardens, the summer home of the Martells, he prefers to watch the children at their play, sitting quietly on the terras amongst the orange trees. He only sees his trusted courtiers and advisors, summoning his brother Oberyn twice every fortnight, and his daughter Arianne twice a year.</Text>

			<Text>Andal Invasion[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]House Martell was founded by Morgan Martell, an Andal adventurer who settled between the mouth of the Greenblood and the Broken Arm. Morgan led the defeat of the local First Men, including Houses Wade and Shell, and the Martells ruled a strip of land fifty leagues long and ten leagues wide. They did not rule as kings, but were cautious vassals of kings from Houses Jordayne, Allyrion, and Yronwood, as well as petty kings of the Greenblood.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Nymeria's War[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]At the time of the Rhoynish Wars, the Martells were one of the lesser ruling families of Dorne, which was a collection of feuding petty kings and lords even as the other regions of Westeros began to consolidate into larger realms. When Nymeria, the warrior queen of the Rhoynar, came with her people to Westeros from Essos in ten thousand ships, the Martell lands were dwarfed by those of House Yronwood. However, Nymeria took Mors Martell, Lord of the Sandship, as her husband and, combining their strength, the two managed to unite all of Dorne under their rule in Nymeria's War; House Nymeros Martell has reigned since.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The union of their peoples saw the Martells abandon many of their older Andal customs in favor of those of the Rhoynar. Nymeria named Mors Prince of Dorne instead of king, and their lands and title passed down to their eldest child, their daughter, regardless of Nymeria marrying again after Mors's death and giving birth to a male child. The Spear Tower and the Tower of the Sun, the towers of Sunspear's Old Palace, were built in the Rhoynish fashion.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Targaryen Wars[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]After Aegon I Targaryen waged his War of Conquest, he came to Dorne. In the First Dornish War his army was bled dry by guerrilla warfare in the desert, a situation in which his dragons were of little use. Deciding that conquering Dorne would be too costly, the Conqueror opted to leave the Martells as sovereign princes. House Martell kept Dorne independent from the Targaryens for two centuries, the only one of the Seven Kingdoms to manage such a feat.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In 110 AC the Martells joined the Triarchy in the war against Prince Daemon Targaryen in the Stepstones. Daemon's brother, King Viserys I Targaryen, spoke of wedding his daughter Rhaenyra to the Prince of Dorne as a way of finally uniting the Seven Kingdoms, though ultimately this did not occur.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]After repeated failed attempts at conquest (most notably under Daeron I and later by Aegon IV), Dorne did eventually join the fold through marriage between the two houses. The alliance was a dual one, with the future King Daeron II marrying Princess Myriah Martell and Prince Maron Martell later marrying Daeron's sister Daenerys.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]During Daeron II's reign, the Red Keep assumed a decidedly Dornish flavor due to the influence of his Martell wife. This was one reason that many nobles opted to rise against his rule in the First Blackfyre Rebellion. The Martells thus defended his claim against Daemon I Blackfyre. After their victory, Maron and Daenerys fulfilled their betrothal, formally bringing Dorne into the Seven Kingdoms. Since then, the Martells have ruled Dorne in the name of the King on the Iron Throne, while keeping the title of Prince of Dorne.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Robert's Rebellion[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In 273 AC, Prince Oberyn and Princess Elia Martell travelled with their mother and her consort to Casterly Rock to visit Joanna Lannister, meeting potential suitors and marriage alliances along the way. The intent was to fulfill their mother's wishes that the Martell and Lannister children would marry. When they arrived, Joanna had just died giving birth to Tyrion Lannister. Lord Tywin Lannister slighted the Martells shamefully, ignoring them for a few weeks before offering Elia the dwarf baby Tyrion, a further slight. Instead of marrying Jaime Lannister, Princess Elia wed Rhaegar Targaryen, Prince of Dragonstone, a slight to Tywin who had hoped to marry his daughter Cersei to Rhaegar.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]When Rhaegar won the tourney at Harrenhal, he named Lyanna Stark the Queen of Love and Beauty, not Elia. A year later, he apparently abducted Lyanna, sparking Robert's Rebellion, also known as the War of the Usurper. Although the Martells were unhappy with Rhaegar's betrayal of Elia, they still supported King Aerys II Targaryen's bid to retain the throne since the Mad King held Elia and her children hostage in the Red Keep. The Dornish provided a quarter of the royal troops at the Battle of the Trident. The Martells lost many soldiers there, including Prince Lewyn Martell of the Kingsguard. When King's Landing fell, Princess Elia and her children were brutally murdered by two Lannister knights, Gregor Clegane and Amory Lorch during the sack of the city.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Oberyn made motions to continue the war in the name of Viserys Targaryen, but the diplomacy between Prince Doran Martell and Jon Arryn prevented further conflict. Though House Martell swore fealty to King Robert Baratheon after the war, they have harbored anger and resentment towards the Lannisters ever since, including Cersei Lannister having become Robert's queen. They have adopted a mostly isolationist policy ever since, not mixing with the other Great Houses unless necessary, preferring to deal instead with the Free Cities.</Text>

			<Text>Daenerys is the youngest child of King Aerys II Targaryen and his sister-wife, Queen Rhaella. Daenerys was conceived during the last month of Robert's Rebellion, the war which ended House Targaryen's reign over the Seven Kingdoms. Shortly thereafter, her mother was sent with the young prince Viserys to the family ancestral seat of Dragonstone to escape the rebel army which was marching towards King's Landing. Daenerys was born nine months after their flight, while a great storm raged above Dragonstone, sinking what remained of the Targaryen fleet; for this reason she is known as "Daenerys Stormborn". Her mother died in labor, but not before naming her.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The war had been lost shortly after Rhaella had fled the city, after which Robert I Baratheon had claimed the throne. With Aerys, his eldest son Rhaegar, and Rhaegar's young children Rhaenys and Aegon dead, Daenerys and her older brother Viserys were the only known living Targaryen heirs. As Viserys had been crowned king on Dragonstone by their mother before her death, Daenerys received the title "Princess of Dragonstone" as Viserys's heir. Robert's brother, Stannis, had built a new fleet for the Baratheon's, and was planning to assault Dragonstone. With the Targaryen fleet destroyed by the storm during which Daenerys had been born, the garrison at Dragonstone planned to sell the Targaryen children to Robert. However, before they could act on this plan, Ser Willem Darry and several other loyal retainers rescued the children and smuggled them into exile, sailing to the Free City of Braavos. There, they lived for years in a house with a red door, where Daenerys had her own room, and a lemon tree underneath her window. Willem was old and sickly, but Daenerys remembers that he always treated her kindly. When Daenerys was five years old, Willem fell sick and slowly wasted away. After his death, the servants he had hired stole all they could. The young Targaryens were put out of the house a while after. As they were forced out, Daenerys wept.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Viserys and Daenerys left Braavos, and wandered the Free Cities for years. They visited nearly all the Free Cities, including Myr, Tyrosh, Qohor, Volantis, and Lys, and returned to Braavos at least once. While at first they were welcomed by magisters and archons and merchant princes, with time doors their interests in the last Targaryens decreased. Daenerys and Viserys had to sell their last few treasures, and eventually their mother's crown. Selling their mother's crown took the last of Viserys's joy, leaving only rage. Daenerys remembers how Viserys once feasted the Golden Company, hoping they would take up his cause, but to on avail. Considering himself to be the rightful ruler, Viserys grew bitter and obsessed with the birthright he had been denied. Daenerys was a frequent target for his frustrations. He had never forgiven her for their mother's death in childbirth, and frequently warned her not to "wake the dragon" by angering him. Once, when Daenerys and Viserys were on their way to Braavos by ship, Daenerys expressed to her brother how fine it would be to be a sailor. Angry, Viserys twisted her hair until she cried. Because Viserys had often told her that their line must be "kept pure", Daenerys had grown up always believing that she would marry Viserys once she came of age.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Though Viserys's growing bitterness made their relationship more troubled, Daenerys also has fond memories of her brother from times when he had not yet been so angry. He let her crawl into bed with him and told her stories about the Seven Kingdoms, about their family and their history, their dragons, and Robert's Rebellion. Almost everything Daenerys knew about Westeros she learned from Viserys, making her feel as if she knew what it was like without ever having been there. Viserys was intent on reclaiming their father's throne, and promised Daenerys a thousand times that he would take her back to Westeros,[ and that their lives would be much better once he had. Viserys also told her about siege towers, and the Faith of the Seven.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In 297 AC, Viserys and Daenerys were taken in by Magister Illyrio Mopatis in the Free City of Pentos, who offered his help in reclaiming the Iron Throne for Viserys. They have lived with Illyrio for almost half a year.</Text>

			<Text>House Targaryen was one of the forty ancient noble houses known as dragonlords who ruled the Valyrian Freehold, a great empire spanning much of Essos. They were considered to be one of the minor houses, however. The family resided in Valyria until Daenys Targaryen, also known as Daenys the Dreamer, the daughter of Lord Aenar Targaryen, had visions of a cataclysm that would come over Valyria. Aenar sold his estates in Valyria and moved his wives, children, other relatives, slaves, wealth, and five dragons (including Balerion) to Dragonstone, an island at the entrance of Blackwater Bay and the westernmost outpost of Valyrian influence, where he took possession of a castle of the same name, in 126 BC. Twelve years later the Doom descended on the city of Valyria, leading to the collapse of the Freehold. The Targaryens were the only dragonriders of Valyria to survive. In the century that followed, four of the five dragons of House Targaryen died, with only Balerion surviving. Two more dragons, Vhagar and Meraxes, were hatched from eggs on Dragonstone, however.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]During the century after the Doom, which became known as the Century of Blood due to the violent struggles for power in Essos, Volantis attempted to seize power over Valyria's colonies. Most of the other Free Cities rebelled against against Volantis, and towards the end of the Century of Blood, the young Lord Aegon Targaryen, rider of the dragon Balerion, was approached by Pentos and Tyrosh to form an alliance. Aegon, mounted on his dragon Balerion, flew first to Pentos to meet its prince, and then to Lys, where he set the Volantene fleet aflame. With Volantis's rule at an end, he returned to Dragonstone, and focussed his attention to the lands west, which had always been of interest to him.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Aegon I's Wars of Conquest[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Aegon Targaryen, Lord of Dragonstone, aspired to unite the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros under one ruler. Slightly more than a hundred years after the Doom of Valyria, in 2 BC, he began his conquest, in which he was aided by his two sister-wives, Rhaenys and Visenya. All three were dragonriders, and used their dragons, Balerion, Meraxes, and Vhagar in battle. Aegon's Conquest lasted for two years. It began with Aegon's landing at the mouth of the Blackwater Rush with a small force, and ended when Aegon was anointed king by the High Septon in Oldtown. In total, he had managed to conquer six of the seven kingdoms, with only Dorne remaining defiant. During the war House Gardener, which had ruled the Reach, and House Hoare, which had ruled the Iron Islands and the riverlands, were extinguished, while House Durrandon, which had reigned over the Stormlands, was continued through the female line. From the swords of his enemies, Aegon created the Iron Throne, and the dynasty he began would rule for nearly three hundred years. Aegon had constructed a wooden castle, the Aegonfort, at the place where he had first come to shore, and the town that grew around it became King's Landing, the kingdom's new capital. Dragonstone remained in the possession of the Targaryens as well, and was one of Aegon's favorite places. The region around King's Landing became known as the crownlands.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In 4 AC, Aegon's wars of conquest continued with the First Dornish War, during which he and Rhaenys attempted to bring the dornish under Targaryen rule as well. A bloody war, during which Queen Rhaenys Targaryen was killed with her dragon, Meraxes, at Hellholt in 10 AC. An assasination attempt on Aegon that same year led to the creation of the Kingsguard, who would guard the kings of the realm for centuries to come. The First Dornish War eventually ended in 13 AC, after Prince Nymor Martell, the Prince of Dorne, had sent his daughter Deria to King's Landing with a letter and the skull of Meraxes. Though the contents of the letter have never been revealed, Aegon agreed to an end of the war the next day.</Text>

			<Text>House Arryn is the ruling house of the Vale. The main seat is at the Eyrie, but they have many other holdings. They alternate between the castles of the Eyrie (during spring and summer) and the Gates of the Moon (after the snow starts falling). Their sigil is a sky-blue falcon soaring against a white moon on sky-blue. Their words are "As High as Honor." The line dates back to the old Andal nation that invaded Westeros. Usually marrying other Andal nobles, House Arryn to this day has the purest line of Andal nobility. Many lesser houses are sworn to House Arryn.</Text>

			<Text>Youth[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Jon was born as the eldest son of Lord Jasper Arryn. He had a younger brother, Ronnel, and a sister, Alys, who married Ser Elys Waynwood. Jon was Keeper of the Gates of the Moon while Jasper lived, and after his father's death Jon named his brother Ronnel and later his cousin Denys to that position. Because of the Vale mountain clans, Jon always traveled in strength when crossing the Mountains of the Moon.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Jon's first wife was Jeyne Royce, but she died in childbed, their daughter stillborn. His second marriage was to Rowena Arryn, a cousin, who died of a winter chill during a childless marriage. Because he had no children, Jon's heir became his nephew, Elbert, the son of Ronnel.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Jon fostered Eddard Stark and Robert Baratheon as his wards in the Vale of Arryn. As they grew, the two boys became close companions and regarded the childless Jon as a second father. The only blade used by Robert was a hunting knife he received from Jon as a boy. Jon declined to foster the grandsons of Lord Walder Frey.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Robert's Rebellion[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Jon's heir, Elbert Arryn, was murdered by King Aerys II Targaryen in King's Landing, and the Mad King then demanded that Jon execute his wards, Eddard Stark and Robert Baratheon. Jon refused, however, and raised his banners in revolt, beginning what would become known as Robert's Rebellion. While Ned Stark returned to the north to call his banners, Jon and Robert led the taking of Gulltown, allowing Robert to return to the stormlands. Lyn Corbray fought against Jon at Gulltown, but submitted after the battle and joined Jon's host.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Ser Denys Arryn, Jon's cousin and new heir, was slain by Lord Jon Connington during the Battle of the Bells. In order to gain Lord Hoster Tully for the rebels, Eddard and Jon agreed to marry Hoster's daughters, Catelyn and Lysa. Because Lysa was proven fertile, Jon hoped to secure a new heir for the failing Arryn line, and so Jon and Eddard married the Tully sisters in a dual ceremony at Riverrun.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Jon participated in the Battle of the Trident, during which Robert killed Aerys's son, Prince Rhaegar Targaryen. During the Sack of King's Landing, not only the Mad King but also Rhaegar's wife, Elia Martell, and children, Princess Rhaenys and Prince Aegon, were killed. Eddard was appalled by the brutality of the acts but Robert's hatred for the Targaryens made him consider the murders necessary, creating a temporary rift between the two that even Lord Arryn was unable to breach. When Robert Baratheon ascended to the Iron Throne, he appointed Jon as his Hand.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Hand of the King[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The first task Jon undertook was making peace with Dorne. The southern region was incensed by the deaths of Prince Lewyn and Princess Elia during the war, and Prince Oberyn Martell tried to raise the kingdom to support Viserys Targaryen, the surviving son of King Aerys II. The year after Robert I Baratheon took the throne (284 AC), Jon returned the bones of Lewyn to Sunspear and brokered a peace with Doran Martell, the Prince of Dorne. However, Ser Gregor Clegane and Ser Amory Lorch, who had killed Elia and her children, went unpunished by Robert, creating a persistent bone of contention between the Iron Throne and Dorne.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]To strengthen Robert's hold on the throne, Jon negotiated the king's marriage with Cersei Lannister and advised that he retain her brother, Ser Jaime, on the Kingsguard, thereby opposing Lord Eddard Stark, who proposed sending Jaime to the Wall for his killing of King Aerys. Robert also considered the assassinations of Viserys and Daenerys, believed to be the last two Targaryens and thus possible threats, but Jon dissuaded the king from the idea.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Robert left Jon with much of the responsibility of running the Seven Kingdoms, but Jon could not stop Robert from spending huge amounts of coin on tournaments and excess, putting the realm in serious debt. While he was at court, Lord Nestor Royce ruled as High Steward of the Vale. Jon appointed Janos Slynt as Commander of the City Watch after the death of Manly Stokeworth.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Jon's marriage with Lysa was loveless, with Lysa finding Jon to be too old and hating his bad breath. After three girls and two boys miscarried, Lysa gave Jon a sickly son and heir, Robert Arryn. Lysa organized for her childhood friend, Petyr Baelish, to administer the customs at Gulltown and later convinced her husband to bring him to the court in King's Landing. Petyr was made master of coin under Jon as Hand. Hugh became Jon's squire. Jon brought Ser Mandon Moore to King's Landing and King Robert made him a member of his Kingsguard, though neither of the two loved him very much.</Text>

			<Text>Edmure was born as the third child and only living son of Hoster Tully and Minisa Whent. His mother died when he was very young.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As a youth, he was known as hot-headed but good-hearted. He had a number of friends who had similar characteristics, most notably Marq Piper. The young Edmure once broke his arm after falling from an elm in Riverrun's godswood. He often went wenching and had a number of affairs. In one case, he had drunk too much and was unable to "perform". A singer, Tom of Sevens, made a mocking song about Edmure, which mentioned a "floppy fish", causing him to develop a dislike of singers in general[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]At the start of what becomes the War of the Five Kings, Edmure takes command of the riverlands due to his father Hoster Tully's illness. When he hears that Ser Jaime Lannister is massing forces at Casterly Rock, Edmure sends Lords Vance and Piper to guard the mountain pass. In response to Ser Gregor Clegane's raids into the riverlands, Edmure spreads his forces along the border; Lord Walder Frey is late in responding to Edmure's summons. Edmure wants to retaliate against the westermen, but Lord Hoster insists the river lords receive permission from King Robert Baratheon first. The Hand of the King, Lord Eddard Stark, sends a detachment under Lord Beric Dondarrion to apprehend Gregor.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]After the death of King Robert and the accession of King Joffrey Baratheon, Lord Tywin Lannister and his brother, Ser Kevan, defeat Edmure's scattered border forces and Gregor ambushes Beric. Tywin's son, Jaime, smashes Vance and Piper at the Golden Tooth and then advances to Riverrun, where he takes Edmure prisoner before its walls in a crushing defeat.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]While Jaime besieges Riverrun, Edmure's nephew, Robb Stark, arrives at Riverrun with his northern host. Robb surprises and destroys the Lannister army and Edmure is rescued by Lord Tytos Blackwood. During the war council held at Riverrun, the northern and river lords proclaim Robb to be King in the North.</Text>

			<Text>Pre-Conquest Era[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]House Tully is an old noble house of First Men origin, dating back to the Age of Heroes. Ser Edmure Tully and his sons were allies of Tristifer IV Mudd, the King of the Rivers and the Hills, but the Tullys knelt to the Andal conqueror Armistead Vance after Tristifer's death. Edmure's son, Axel Tully, received land at the junction of the Red Fork and the Tumblestone, where he constructed Riverrun.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Unlike many Great Houses the Tullys never ruled as kings, but held Riverrun for a thousand years as powerful vassals of those who did. They often defended the Trident from the Kings of the Rock. Lord Elston Tully died supporting Lord Roderick Blackwood against King Humfrey I Teague. Lord Tommen Tully futilely supported Lady Agnes Blackwood against Harwyn Hoare, King of the Iron Islands, and Tommen's natural son Samwell Rivers was slain at the Tumblestone.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Targaryen Dynasty[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]House Tully rose to prominence during Aegon's Conquest, when Lord Edmyn Tully led the rebel river lords who deserted King Harren the Black and joined Aegon the Conqueror. Following the burning of Harrenhal, Edmyn was rewarded with dominion over the riverlands as the Lord Paramount of the Trident. One of Edmyn's daughters married Lord Quenton Qoherys of Harrenhal, while Edmyn himself served two years as Hand of the King to King Aegon I.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]King Aenys I Targaryen relied on the Tullys during the rebellion of Harren the Red, and King Maegor I Targaryen was supported by the Tullys and the Harroways against Prince Aegon Targaryen in the Battle Beneath the Gods Eye. The Tullys later supported Prince Jaehaerys Targaryen against Maegor.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In 101 AC during the Great Council, Lord Grover Tully spoke in favor of Prince Viserys Targaryen over Laenor Velaryon as the successor to Jaehaerys I. During the Dance of the Dragons, the Tullys ruled over, in name at least, the quarrelsome river lords. The aged Lord Grover wanted to support the greens, but his grandson Elmo and great-grandson Kermit supported the blacks. Elmo led the riverlords to battle on the side of Rhaenyra during the Second Battle of Tumbleton. His father died soon after, and Elmo himself followed his father to the grave forty-nine days later. His young son Kermit led the Lads and slew Lord Borros Baratheon in the Battle of the Kingsroad.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Tullys were Targaryen loyalists during the Blackfyre Rebellions. Lord Medgar Tully participated in the tourney at Ashford Meadow, where he challenged Ser Humfrey Hardyng in his first tilt but was defeated. Two years later, during the reign of Aerys I Targaryen, there was a new Lord Tully, a boy of eight (in 211 AC). He was surrounded by women, indicating he had no brothers or uncles.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Recent History[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Given the riverlands' geographic vulnerability, House Tully has often sought alliances in case of invasion. Lord Hoster Tully sought to wed his brother, Ser Brynden Tully, hero of the War of the Ninepenny Kings, to Bethany Redwyne, but Brynden would have none of it. During the years-long quarrel between the two, Brynden took the moniker "Blackfish".[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Hoster also took a ward, Petyr Baelish, an obscure lordling from the Fingers. Petyr fell in love with Lord Tully's eldest daughter, Catelyn, but was rebuffed. As consolation he took the virginity of Lysa, Hoster's other daughter. Hoster forbade Petyr from marrying either of his daughters due to his low standing, and ordered Lysa to drink moon tea to prevent her from bearing Petyr's child. Hoster accepted an offer from Lord Tywin Lannister to wed Ser Jaime Lannister to Lysa, but Jaime unexpectedly joined the Kingsguard before this could occur. Hoster rebuffed Tywin's offer of his younger son, Tyrion, as a replacement. Other prospects existed from House Brax and others, but Hoster finally accepted an offer from Lord Rickard Stark that Catelyn be betrothed to Brandon Stark, heir to Winterfell. Petyr dueled Brandon for Catelyn's favor, resulting in his exile from Riverrun.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The executions of Brandon and Rickard by King Aerys II Targaryen complicated matters, but Lord Hoster threw in with the ensuing rebellion of Lord Robert Baratheon against Targaryen rule, arranging for Catelyn to wed Brandon's brother, Lord Eddard Stark, and for Lysa to marry Lord Jon Arryn. The riverlands was a major theater in Robert's Rebellion, and Lord Hoster fought in the Battle of the Bells His control over his bannermen was not complete, however, as Houses Darry, Mooton, and Ryger supported House Targaryen. Hoster also crushed the royalist House Goodbrook. House Frey delayed their contribution until after the decisive Battle of the Trident, itself fought in the riverlands. After the war, the Tully girls rode off to their husbands' seats, with Ser Brynden accompanying Lysa to the Vale of Arryn to serve as Knight of the Gate.</Text>

Four hundred years ago or more, probably around the time of the Doom of Valyria, the Dothraki rode toward the Free Cities out of the east, sacking and burning every town and city in their path, including the Kingdom of Sarnor, the Qaathi cities in the Red Waste, and the Ibbenese settlements in the Kingdom of the Ifequevron. Khal Temmo and his khalasar of at least 50,000 were stopped by the Unsullied in the Battle of Qohor. During the Century of Blood after the Doom, the Dothraki drove smallfolk from their hovels and nobles from their estates, until only grass and ruins remained from the forest of Qohor to the headwaters of the Selhoru.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Ruined cities and regions ring the vast plains of the Dothraki sea, including the Kingdom of Sarnor, the Kingdom of the Ifequevron, the upper Skahazadhan, and the red waste.

			<Text>According to Selyse Florent, Mance's parents were a common woman of the free folk and a man of the Night's Watch. After a group of raiders were put to the sword when Mance was a child, he was taken by the Night's Watch and raised as one of them. His last name of "Rayder" comes from this origin.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A ranger of the Shadow Tower, Mance often sang of Bael the Bard after returning from rangings beyond the Wall. When Lord Commander Qorgyle traveled to Winterfell to meet with Lord Eddard Stark, Mance rode escort and met the young Robb Stark and Jon Snow.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Mance was attacked by a shadowcat while ranging, and was healed by a wildling woman. While he recuperated, she mended his torn cloak with swatches of red fabric. Upon returning to the Wall, Ser Denys Mallister required Mance to replace his mended cloak with one of uniform black. This infringement of freedom caused Mance to abandon the Shadow Tower and live with the free folk in the way he wished.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Mance spent years gathering various tribes into one host, seeking support from clan mothers and magnars. He made peace between Harma Dogshead and the Lord of Bones, the Hornfoots and the Nightrunners, and the men of the Frozen Shore and the ice-river clans. Opposed by five other would-be Kings-Beyond-the-Wall, Mance gained the support of Tormund of Ruddy Hall and Styr of Thenn and slew the three rivals who refused to submit.</Text>

			<Text>History[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The free folk descend from the First Men.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Hardhome, the largest settlement of the free folk, was destroyed six hundred years ago. Maester Wyllis writes about the free folk in Hardhome: An Account of Three Years Spent Beyond-the-Wall among Savages, Raiders, and Woods-witches.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Some Kings-Beyond-the-Wall have occasionally led hosts of free folk south of the Wall, but they have eventually been defeated by the Night's Watch or northern lords, such as House Stark and House Umber.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Mance Rayder slew three rivals and forced the submissions of Styr, Magnar of Thenn, and Tormund Giantsbane while becoming King-Beyond-the-Wall. The various free folk clans have been unable to withstand the Others.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Culture[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Wall which separates the free folk from the rest of Westeros in many ways defines them. The free folk refer to themselves as such to differentiate themselves from "kneelers," the people south of the Wall subject to lords and kings. The free folk view "kneelers" as lacking freedom, whereas the people of the Seven Kingdoms to the south view "wildlings" as lawless and primitive killers, rapists, and thieves.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Due to their isolation, the free folk remain a people free of states, nobles, kings, and laws but those of their own choosing, following whichever leader they please. The free folk believe that the gods made the earth for all men to share and when the kings came with their crowns and their steel swords, they stole it by claiming it was all theirs and theirs alone. There is little in the way of law or property rights in the lands of the free folk. They take what they can and keep what they can defend and have little interest in marriage.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Society[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Folk folk society is made of many tribes and clans, each with their own peculiarities and customs. Some recognize chieftains, while others exist in a perpetual state of conflict, warring against each other and themselves. The free folk place importance in a man keeping his word. Some clans are led by clan mothers or magnars.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Some clans live in small villages in the haunted forest, such as Whitetree, while others reside in halls such as Craster's Keep or Ruddy Hall. Thenns live in a hidden valley in the Frostfangs. Some are semi-nomadic loners, held down only by their own needs. By "kneeler" standards, strange clans include the Hornfoots, the Nightrunners, the men of the Frozen Shore, the cannibal ice-river clans, and the cave dwellers.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Skinchangers and wargs are more accepted north of the Wall than in the Seven Kingdoms. Wildlings burn their dead.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Languages[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The free folk keep to the ways of the First Men and there are many languages beyond the Wall, including the Common Tongue. The Old Tongue of the First Men is still spoken by some, such as the Thenns[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Enmities[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The free folk do not hate northmen as much as they hate the "crows" of the Night's Watch, who represent the gate keepers holding them beyond the Wall. The free folk do not spare brothers of the Night's Watch, unless they break their oaths and prove it. However, the two groups are not beyond some form of cooperation. The two groups sometimes trade at Eastwatch-by-the-Sea, lost brothers have been aided by free folk, and the Watch sometimes take free folk children and raise them to be members.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Nightrunners fight Hornfoots, while factions of the men of the Frozen Shore feud amongst each other.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Religion[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Most free folk worship the old gods. The Thenns view their Magnar as closer to a god than a lord, however. The men of the Frozen Shore believe in gods of snow and ice, while crab gods may also be worshipped at Storrold's Point. Cave dwellers allegedly worship dark underground gods. Gilly, one of Craster's wives, speaks of cold gods who take boys.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Spearwives[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In keeping with the spirit of free folk independence, women are welcome to take up arms and fight alongside men. Such women are called spearwives, and are known to be every bit as ferocious as their male counterparts.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Marriage[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In marriage, the men are expected to be quite forceful with women, going so far as stealing them from their home or clan. The women, in turn, are expected to put up a fight every step of the way. It is believed that a true man will steal a woman from afar to strengthen the clan. Men must steal daughters, but not wives of other men. When the red wanderer is within the Moonmaid, it is considered a propitious time for a man to steal a woman.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Women who wed brothers, fathers, or clan kin are believed to offend the gods, and are cursed with weak and sickly children.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Naming[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Because infant mortality is common in the harsh environment beyond the Wall, it is believed to be bad luck to name a child before he or she reaches two years of age. A temporary milk name or nickname can be given to a child prior to the official naming.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Raiding[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Raiding south of the Wall is a large part of free folk culture. Raiders start at a young age, as little as twelve years. Raiders either climb the Wall or use little boats to cross the Bay of Seals around it. Climbing the height of the Wall is an exercise that can take most of a day and rangers of the Night's Watch often find the broken bodies of those who have fallen.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]To climb the Wall, the free folk use the aid of huge ladders of woven hemp, boots of supple doeskin spiked with iron, bronze, or jagged bone, small stone-headed hammers, stakes of iron and bone and horn, and antlers with sharpened tines bound to wooden hafts with strips of hide serving as ice axes.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Over the decades, with the weakening of the Night's Watch, the free folk have found it much easier to either climb the Wall or paddle small boats through the Bay of Seals, growing bolder they raid as far as the Umber lands, the northern mountain clans, or Bear Island, instead of the usual villages and holdfasts in the Gift.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Raiders cross the Wall to steal swords and axes, spices, silks, furs, and any valuables they can find. They are known to take women in any season to carry them off beyond the Wall.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Armament[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Most free folk warriors wield weaponry forged of stone, wood, and bronze, such as stone axes and flails, fire-hardened spears and lances, and bows of wood and horn. Their bows are outranged by the yew longbows of the south, but can seemingly shoot an arrow as high as seven hundred feet.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The free folk do not mine nor smelt and there are few smiths and fewer forges north of the Wall; the only metal armor that they wear are bits and pieces looted from dead rangers. Most will wear boiled leather or sewn sheepskins and use crude round shields of skin stretched over wicker, painting them with figures such as skulls and bones, serpents, bear claws, twisted demonic faces, and severed heads.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Thenns are more well-armed and armored than most free folk, with bronze helms, axes, short stabbing spears with leaf-shaped heads, shirts sewn with bronze discs, and plain unadorned shields of black boiled leather with bronze rims and bosses.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Free folk horses are surefooted, but scarce.</Text>

			<Text>Roose is of average size with a soft and hairless body. He has a plain face, beardless and ordinary, with his only noticeable feature being his eyes, paler than stone and darker than milk, strange like two white moons. His eyes are paler than those of his son, Ramsay. Roose has short, strong fingers. He has a pasty skin and pallid chest.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Though mild-mannered, Roose is remorseless and implacable. He is considered to be cold and cunning. According to Theon Greyjoy, Roose has "more cruelty in his pinky toe than all the Freys combined". Roose's voice is small and soft; he rarely raises his voice, forcing those who listen to do so intently, falling silent. Roose sips his alcohol, preferring hippocras, or hot spiced wine, although he is also willing to drink ale and regular wine. Roose's personal motto is "A peaceful land, a quiet people."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Roose often wears black ringmail and a spotted pink fur cloak. He also owns a suit of dark grey plate armor over a quilted tunic of blood-red leather. Its rondels are shaped like human heads whose mouths are open in agony. Its helmet has streamers of red silk which flutter in the wind. With it is usually a pink woolen cloak embroidered with droplets of blood.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]History[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Roose practices the abolished tradition of the first night, but he is discreet with his activities and amusements in order to avoid the attention and possible ire of the Wardens of the North, House Stark. While hunting along the Weeping Water, Roose once raped a young miller's wife and hanged the miller for not gaining his approval for their marriage. When the woman later presented a baby to Roose, he spared the bastard boy Ramsay because he had the same pale eyes as Roose. Lord Bolton granted the mill to the woman, sent her annual supplies and funds, and had the tongue of the miller's brother cut out to prevent Lord Rickard Stark from learning what had happened.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Roose fought at the Battle of the Trident during Robert's Rebellion. When Ser Barristan Selmy, seriously wounded, was brought before Lord Robert Baratheon, Roose counselled that they should kill him. Robert ignored Roose and spared Barristan's life, sending his own maester to tend to the Kingsguard's wounds. According to a semi-canon source, Roose helped to suppress Greyjoy's Rebellion.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]After the death of his first wife, Roose was married to Bethany Ryswell, with whom he had one son survive the cradle, Domeric. Roose's children who did not survive the cradle have been buried below the Dreadfort. Roose had Domeric serve as a page to Bethany's sister, Lady Barbrey Dustin, in Barrowton and as a squire to Lord Horton Redfort at the Redfort. Roose had Reek, a servant at the Dreadfort who always smelled terrible, whipped for stealing Bethany's perfume in an attempt to mask his stench. When the mother of his bastard son appeared at the Dreadfort demanding Roose provide her with a servant to help in raising her son, Roose sent her Reek, an act which he intended to be amusing. Roose eventually became a widower when his wife Bethany died of a fever.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In 297 AC, Domeric died after visiting his half brother, Ramsay. Maester Uthor blamed a bad belly, but Lord Bolton attributes his heir's death to poisoning by Ramsay. Having no other trueborn heirs, Roose brought Ramsay to the Dreadfort but is not believed to have acknowledged him.</Text>

			<Text>The Boltons are an ancient and powerful house of the north who once ruled as Red Kings from the Dreadfort. Their land reached from the Last River and the White Knife to the Sheepshead Hills. It has been suggested that the legendary Night's King was a Bolton.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Since the Long Night the Red Kings were bitter rivals of the Kings of Winter, the Starks of Winterfell. The Boltons achieved some successes against the Starks, with Kings Royce II and Royce IV burning Winterfell. The Boltons are said to have flayed the skins of several Stark lords and hung them in the Dreadfort. According to rumor, some Bolton lords wore the flayed skins of their enemies—including Starks, such as the son of Bael as cloaks. This practice has given the Boltons a sinister reputation. The last Red King, Rogar the Huntsman, submitted to Winterfell when the Andal invasion of Westeros was also beginning. King Theon Stark, the Hungry Wolf, and the Boltons defeated Argos Sevenstar and his Andals in the Battle of the Weeping Water.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Thousands of years ago, the Dreadfort rose in an unsuccessful rebellion with the Greystarks of the Wolf's Den against the Starks. The Boltons survived the rebellion, although the Greystarks did not.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Chronicles of Longsister state that during the Rape of the Three Sisters by the Kings of Winter, which occurred two thousand years ago, Belthasar Bolton had a Pink Pavilion made from the flayed skins of a hundred Sistermen.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Boltons threatened Winterfell during the reign of King Edrick Snowbeard. At some point unspecified centuries ago, the Boltons rebelled against the Starks. The Stark armies besieged the Dreadfort for two years before the Boltons capitulated to King Harlon Stark and dipped their banners once more.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"A thousand years ago", the Boltons bent their knees to Winterfell and agreed to abandon their practice of flaying their enemies. For many centuries the Boltons have remained loyal to the Starks, although rumors persist that they continue to flay their prisoners in secret and maintain a hidden chamber in the Dreadfort to display the skins of their enemies.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]When Lord Eddard Stark called the banners of the north to fight in Robert's Rebellion, Lord Roose Bolton took up arms, fighting in the Battle of the Trident. Afterward, he counseled that Lord Robert Baratheon should slash the throat of the legendary Kingsguard knight Ser Barristan Selmy, but Robert sent for his maesters instead.</Text>

			<Text>Before he became a White Walker, the Night King was a First Man that was captured by Children of the Forest, Leaf among them. Leaf pressed a dragonglass dagger into his chest, causing his eyes to turn blue and turning him into the first of the White Walkers. The Children of the Forest created the White Walkers to defend themselves when Westeros was invaded by the First Men, who were cutting their sacred trees and slaughtering them.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Night King first appears in a vision of Bran Stark when he communes with a weirwood heart tree. Bran experiences a flood of images but he does not comprehend what they are. In retrospect, one of them is an image of the Night King picking up the last of Craster's sons on an ice altar.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The last infant son of Craster is taken by a White Walker from the haunted forest to the Lands of Always Winter, where they are awaited by the Night King and a group of thirteen black-garbed White Walkers. The baby is placed in an icy altar ringed by large icy spikes, which the Night King starts approaching. When the Night King takes the boy into his arms the baby immediately calms and then he touches the child's face with his index finger, turning his eyes icy blue and his skin to grow pale.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Night King commands White Walkers and wights during their attack on Hardhome. He watches from one of the cliffs above the town as Jon Snow slays one of his lieutenants with Longclaw. As Jon, Tormund and the remaining defenders leave on the boat, the Night King appears on the dock and locks eyes with Jon. With a mere raise of his arms, the Night King raises the entirety of Hardhome's slain free folk as wights, and he keeps his gaze upon Jon as the boat slips away.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Night King appears in another of Bran's visions, where the boy witnesses him as a human being transformed into a White Walker by the Children of the Forest.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Later, when Bran decides to experience a vision on his own, he finds himself looking at an army of wights and the Night King and the other White Walkers at the back. Bran walks closer and is shocked to see that the Night King notices his presence. Bran wakes up screaming after the Night King suddenly appeared right next to him. The Three-Eyed Raven says that the Night King touched him, which Bran confirms when a blue hand-mark is imprinted on his forearm. The Three-Eyed Raven says because of that mark, the Night King now knows exactly where they are, and the cave cannot protect them any more.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Night King and his army quickly travel to the cave, preceded by their aura of cold which notifies the Children of the Forest and Meera Reed. The Children of the Forest prepare their scarce defenses outside of the cave, but are quickly overrun and they are forced to retreat back to the tunnels. The Night King sends his army of wights to attack the tunnels, and they kill most of the Children and Summer, though Bran, Meera and Hodor manage to leave the cavern. The Night King enters the cavern, and glares at the Three-Eyed Raven before he kills him. The Night King then sends the rest of his wights to go after Bran.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Bran using his gift to to see through the eyes of ravens spots the Night Kings army marching towards the wall, the night king looks up at the ravens and bran immediately loses his connection.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]While Jon Snow and his band go North of the Wall to capture a Wight as proof to the rest of theSeven Kingdoms of the threat approaching. They are later trapped and encircled by the Night King's army, Jon theorises that if they slay the Night King, it will collapse the rest of his undead horde.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Daenerys and her three Dragons arrive to rescue Jon and the survivors. The Dragons lay waste to the Night King's army. One of the Night Kings lieutenants hands his master a spear made of ice. The Night King targets the Dragon Viserion who is in flight and laying waste to his forces with his flaming breath.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Night King throws the spear like a javelin. The enchanted weapon sails through the air and impales the White Dragon causing him to crash into the ice of the lake, where he dies before sinking. The Night King is handed a second spear and attempts to take down Drogon as he takes off and flees but the Dragon dodges the projectile.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Night Kings forces later use chains taken from Hardhome to pull Viserions corpse from the lake. The Night King then places his hand on the Dead dragons head and his eyes open, now bright blue.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Taking the undead Viserion as his personal mount, the Night King assaults the Wall at Eastwatch-by-the-Sea. Viserion now breathing magical blue flames melts the section of the wall causing it to collapse. The army of wights led by White Walkers marches through the ruins of the fallen Wall while the Night King flies overhead.</Text>

			<Text>Description[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Others are tall and gaunt, with flesh pale as milk. They have cold blue eyes that have been described as burning like ice, or being as bright as blue stars. Others have pale blue blood and shiny bones like milkglass.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Others appear to be superior swordsmen, wielding thin crystal swords. The pale swords are extremely sharp, capable of moving through ringmail as if it is silk. The swords are alive with moonlight and have a faint blue glow to them. When the sword touches a steel blade, only a high, thin sound, similar to an animal screaming in pain, can be heard instead of the sound of metal on metal. When the blades brush the flames of a torch, a screech as sharp as a needle can be heard. The blades the Others use seem to be rather cold; They are able to cover a metal blade in frost, and shatter a steel blade.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Others are capable of resurrecting dead men or creatures as wights. Only burning the bodies of the deceased can prevent the Others from resurrecting them. There are tales of Others riding the corpses of dead animals such as bears, direwolves, mammoths, and horses. Some tales also speak of Others riding "giant ice spiders".[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Others go lightly on the snow and leave no prints to mark their passage. Their movements can be lightning quick and graceful. Extreme cold accompanies them, but it is unknown whether the Others only come when it is so cold, or whether they bring the cold with them. White mist also rises when they are near. They might appear during snowstorms or mist, and melt away when the skies clear. They hide from the light of the sun and emerge at night; although once again some stories claim that their coming brings the night. They are said also hate iron and fire. The language the Others speak is unknown, but has been described as sounding like "the cracking of ice on a winter lake", and their laughter as being as sharp as icicles.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]According to Old Nan, the Others hate "every creature with hot blood in its veins". Stannis Baratheon calls them "demons made of ice and snow and cold". Melisandre, a priestess of R'hllor, believes that the Others are the "cold children" of the Great Other, allegedly an evil god of darkness, cold, and death who wages eternal war against R'hllor. The wildlings believe the Others and their wights can smell life, or rather its warmth. According to the stories of Old Nan, the wildlings give the women they steal from the Seven Kingdoms to the Others, and used to lay with the Others during the Long Night to birth half-human children. According to his wives, the wildling Craster leaves his sons for the Others, who he calls "the gods", come the "white cold", and, when he does not have any sons to give, gives them sheep. Craster's wives believe that Craster's sons become Others as well. Craster calls himself a godly man, and as such believes he does not have to fear any attacks from the Others or their wights.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Others have a few known weaknesses that are recorded in ancient texts. One is obsidian, otherwise called dragonglass or "frozen fire". Ancient texts also record a weakness to "dragonsteel", which some think may be Valyrian steel. Mance Rayder and his wife Dalla believe that the Wall prevents the Others from crossing into the Seven Kingdoms.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]History[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]According to legend, the Others came from the Lands of Always Winter six or eight thousand years ago, and brought with them cold and darkness that lasted a generation: the Long Night. They resurrected dead men and animals to serve them. In the Battle for the Dawn, they were finally defeated, by the first men of the Night's Watch and the children of the forest, an alliance made possible by the last hero.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Night's King, the thirteenth Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, is said to have married a woman with pale skin and blue eyes, matching the description of the Others. Reportedly, she was a sorceress. He brought her to the Nightfort, where he proclaimed himself king and her his queen, and bound his Sworn Brothers in the Night's Watch to his will. After a thirteen-year reign, he was defeated by Brandon the Breaker, King of Winter, and Joramun, King-Beyond-the-Wall, after which it was discovered that he had been sacrificing to the Others.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In his Lies of the Ancients Archmaester Fomas speculates that the Others were a tribe of the First Men who had been living in the far north. Fomas suggests that the Long Night pressured these men, the ancestors of the current wildlings, to migrate south. Over the years, they became more and more monstrous in the telling of the tales about them, because the Night's Watch and the Starks wanted to seem heroic. However, Lies of the Ancients is little regarded nowadays, as it contains erroneous claims about Valyria, the Reach, and the westerlands.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Wall was built to protect the people of the realms in Westeros from the threats of the north, specifically the Others. However, the Others have not been seen since the Long Night ended, and are now regarded as nothing more than fairy tales to frighten the little children. Some people believe they never existed at all. They are often mentioned in curses, such as "The Others take his eyes."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Recent Events[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]During a ranging beyond the Wall, Ser Waymar Royce is confronted by a group of at least five Others who speak an icy language. Waymar duels one of the Others, but the ranger is blinded when his sword shatters. The laughing group butchers Waymar, who then rises as a wight to slay Will.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Lord Commander Jeor Mormont, in conversation with Tyrion Lannister at Castle Black, refers to white walkers being glimpsed by fisherfolk on the shore near Eastwatch-by-the-Sea. Tyrion discounts them, however, by mentioning mythical merlings.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Old Nan tells Bran Stark about the Long Night, when white walkers moved through woods.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Traveling in the wolfswood, Bran encounters six wildlings and deserters from the Night's Watch, who discuss whether to take the boy hostage and return north to sell him to Mance Rayder, the King-Beyond-the-Wall. Out of fear for encountering the white walkers, one of the men decides not to do so.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]At Craster's Keep, Gilly tells Jon Snow that Craster gives up his infant sons to the cold gods; Jon determines she is speaking of the Others.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Encamped at the Fist of the First Men, the Night's Watch hear three horn blasts signifying Others. The brothers are then attacked by wights in the fight at the Fist.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]While the survivors retreat through the haunted forest back to Craster's Keep, an Other knocks away Grenn's torch and kills Small Paul. Samwell Tarly stabs it in the throat with a dragonglass dagger, however, and Sam hears a sound similar to the cracking of ice beneath one's foot. The Other's armor, flesh, and bones melt away as a result, dissolving away until nothing remains. Sam is dubbed Sam the Slayer, which he finds mocking.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]During the mutiny at Craster's Keep, one of Craster's wives warns Sam that Craster's sons will soon arrive for Gilly's newborn boy.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]At the parley during the battle beneath the Wall, Mance Rayder reveals to Jon that he is trying to lead the free folk south of the Wall to protect them from the Others and their wights.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Sam finds limited information about the Others while researching in the library of Castle Black.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Jon Snow, now the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, and Tormund discuss their common foe, the Others, when Tormund's four thousand wildlings cross the Wall. Jon asks if the Others troubled the wildlings on their march to the Wall, and Tormund informs him that the Others had been with them all the way, though they never attacked the free folk in force.</Text>

			<Text>Ancient History[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The old gods were originally worshiped by the children of the forest in most of Westeros in the Dawn Age, thousands of years before the arrival of the First Men from Essos via the Arm of Dorne. The First Men warred with the children and, believing that the greenseers of the children could see through the eyes of the weirwoods, cut down the weirwoods where they found them. The children at Moat Cailin are said to have called upon their nameless gods to use the hammer of the waters, and other tales say they performed blood sacrifice at the Isle of Faces.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In time, however, the First Men made peace with the children at the Isle of Faces within the Gods Eye, agreeing to the Pact. In time, they adopted the gods of the children as their own. Other religions of the First Men included the Lady of the Waves and the Lord of the Skies, worshiped on the Three Sisters, and the Drowned God, which is still worshiped on the Iron Islands.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]When Corlos spared lion cubs within Casterly Rock, the old gods are said to have rewarded him by revealing gold in Casterly Rock. According to Archmaester Eyron, the crannogmen often thought that their kings were touched by the old gods.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Arrival of the Andals[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Worship of the old gods remained strong across Westeros until the Andal invasion, with the Andals bringing their Faith of the Seven with them from Andalos. The Andals gradually conquered the south of Westeros. Seeing the old gods as little more than demons, the Andals destroyed the great white trees wherever they found them. All weirwoods in the south were cut down, and the worship of the old gods was supplanted with the gods of the Andals own. House Blackwood in the riverlands serves as an exception. The old gods are still worshipped in the north, however, and by the free folk living beyond the Wall. Some clans of the free folk are said to worship different deities than the old gods, however.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Recent History[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Humfrey I Teague, King of the Rivers and the Hills, attempted to suppress worship of the old gods in the riverlands, resulting in the downfall of House Teague and control of the riverlands by House Durrandon.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]During the tourney at Harrenhal, a crannogman prayed to the old gods of north and Neck. During the tourney, the Knight of the Laughing Tree used a shield decorated with a heart tree of the old gods.</Text>

			<Text>Red God[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]R'hllor, also known as the Lord of Light, the Heart of Fire, the God of Flame and Shadow, is a prominent god in Essos, but has only a few followers in Westeros, where he is more commonly known as the red god. His symbol is a fiery heart. Red priests lead prayers to R'hllor at red temples.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]History[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A prophecy found in ancient books of Asshai claims that after a long summer an evil cold darkness shall fall on the world. Azor Ahai, wielding the sword Lightbringer, shall be reborn to combat this darkness. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In an attempt to gain more followers in Westeros, the red priest Thoros of Myr was sent to the royal court of King's Landing. There, he was to try and convert the fire-obsessed King Aerys II Targaryen. However, Thoros was unsuccessful and even started to question his own faith. Thoros remained in King’s Landing, and as such was present during the immediate aftermath of the Sack of King’s Landing. He remained at court during the reign of King Robert I Baratheon, becoming the king’s frequent drinking companion. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The red priestess Melisandre travels to Dragonstone on her own initiative in search of the prophesied prince Azor Ahai. She is convinced that Dragonstone is the place of smoke and salt amidst which Azor Ahai shall be reborn. She comes to believe that Stannis Baratheon, the Lord of Dragonstone, is Azor Ahai reborn, and eventually becomes a confidant to Stannis's wife, Selyse Florent. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Like other types of magic, the magic of R'hllor seems to have faded after the last Targaryen dragons died.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Recent Events[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]At Dragonstone, the red priestess Melisandre wields fire magic and convinces Stannis Baratheon to claim the mantle of Azor Ahai. Followers of R'hllor at Stannis's court are known as queen's men.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Thoros of Myr explains to Arya Stark that he surprisingly resurrected Beric Dondarrion after performing the last kiss. Many of the brotherhood without banners now worship the Lord of Light.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In Qohor, the followers of R'hllor try to burn the Black Goat.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Ser Daven Lannister informs Ser Jaime Lannister that his scouts have spotted night fires in the high places and villages near the siege of Riverrun.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In Volantis, Benerro preaches that Daenerys Targaryen is Azor Ahai reborn and encourages many to support her.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Melisandre believes that her power is stronger at the Wall than it had been in Asshai.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]According to the High Sparrow, the new High Septon, Stannis has turned from the truth of the Seven to worship a red demon, and his false faith has no place in the Seven Kingdoms.</Text>

		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_RELIGIONS_PAGE_RELIGION_SEVEN_GODS_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1" Language="en_US">
			<Text>New Gods[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Faith of the Seven, often simply referred to to as the Faith, is the dominant religion in most of the Seven Kingdoms. Followers of the Faith in the north are rare and are generally not found on the Iron Islands, where the religions of the old gods of the First Men and of the Drowned God respectively are still strong. The gods of the Faith are sometimes known as the new gods to differentiate them from the old gods from the north.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]History[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Andals[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Faith of the Seven arose among the Andals who lived in the hills of Andalos. It is claimed that the Seven walked there in human form. According to The Seven-Pointed Star, the Father brought down seven stars from heaven and placed them on the brow of Hugor of the Hill, the first king of the Andals, to form his crown. The Maid brought forth a girl supple as a willow with eyes like deep blue pools that became Hugor his first wife, the Mother made her fertile, who bore him forty-four mighty sons as foretold by the Crone. The Warrior gave each son strength of arms and the Smith wrought each a suit of iron plate. It is said that when she peered through the door of death, the Crone let the first raven into the world.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Faith was brought to Westeros when the Andals invaded from Essos thousands of years ago, and largely supplanted the local worship of the old gods. Some of the Andal warriors had the seven-pointed star of the Faith carved into their flesh to show their devotion. Although the Andals came late to the Reach, the Hightowers were among the first Westerosi lords to welcome the Andals, considering war bad for trade. Lord Damon Hightower was the first to accept the Faith. To honor the Seven, he constructed the first sept in Oldtown, and six more elsewhere in his realm. Following his premature death, Septon Robeson became regent for Damon’s newborn son, Triston. When Septon Robeson eventually died, Tristane had the Starry Sept raised in his honor. Oldtown eventually became the center of the Faith, and the Starry Sept home to the High Septon.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Aegon the Conqueror[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]When he learned that Aegon the Conqueror had landed in Westeros, the High Septon locked himself in the Starry Sept for seven days and nights, seeking guidance from the gods. On the seventh day, the High Septon saw a vision given to him by the Crone, showing him that if Oldtown resisted Aegon, the Hightower, Citadel, and Starry Sept would burn. The High Septon warned Lord Manfred Hightower of what he had seen, after which the Lord of the Hightower decided to offer no resistance to the Targaryens. Aegon dated the start of his reign from the day the High Septon anointed him at the Starry Sept. Since then, it has been traditional for the High Septon to give their blessing to every new king.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Targaryens had converted to the Faith on Dragonstone before Aegon’s day, and Aegon himself always treaded lightly with the Faith. When a marriage was proposed between Aegon’s younger son Maegor and the newborn daughter of his elder son, the High Septon protested. He suggested his own niece, Lady Ceryse Hightower, as a bride for the young prince. Maegor and Ceryse were subsequently wed in 25 AC at the Starry Sept in Oldtown, and matters calmed down again.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Faith Militant uprising[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Issues arose during the reign of Aegon I’s heir, Aenys I Targaryen, when Prince Maegor secretly took a second wife in 39 AC. The polygamous marriage angered the Faith, and Aenys felt forced to exile his brother when Maegor refused to set Alys aside. Although Maegor left for Pentos, the High Septon was not yet satisfied. As such, Aenys appointed Septon Murmison as his new Hand of the King, but even he could not heal the rift between the throne and the Faith.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]However, when Aenys wed his daughter Rhaena and son Aegon to one another in 41 AC, the High Septon denounced him, calling him "King Abomination"; This was the start of the Faith Militant uprising, during which even the pious lords and smallfolk who had loved Aenys turned against the king.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Faith Militant uprising lasted the remaining year of Aenys I’s reign, and the entire reign of his brother and successor, Maegor I. Maegor placed a bounty on the Faith Militant, and put out a decree that prohibited the Faith from arming itself. During Maegor’s campaigns against the Faith, thousands died. Although Maegor’s death resulted in the end of the campaigns, conflicts between the Crown and the Faith lasted until about a decade into the reign of Maegor’s successor, Jaehaerys I. Jaehaerys I eventually resolved the issues between the crown and the Faith by promising that the Crown would always protect and defend the Faith. In return, the last few Stars and Swords were to put down their weapons, and the Faith was to agree to accept justice from the Iron Throne from that moment onwards.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Baelor the Blessed[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The septon-king Baelor I assumed the Iron Throne in 161 AC. The most pious of all Targaryen kings, Baelor’s interests were the Seven. He convinced the High Septon to dissolve his marriage to his sister, Daena Targaryen, arguing that the marriage had been contracted before he had become king, and in addition had never been consummated. Next, Baelor placed all three of his sisters in what would become known as the Maidenvault, where only maidens were allowed to join them. The king stated that he wished to preserve their innocence, but some wondered whether Baelor had done so to because he feared the temptation of their beauty himself.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Baelor’s edicts became more and more concerned with spiritual matters, and grew more and more zealous and erratic as his reign continued. He even took a septon’s vows, preventing himself from ever marrying again. Meanwhile, the High Septon grew more and more influential. When he died, Baelor declared to the Most Devout that the Seven had revealed to him the identity of the new High Septon. The Most Devout elected Baelor’s choice; A stonemason who carved his stonework so beautifully that Baelor was convinced he was the Smith in human form. However, the man could neither read nor write, and was unable to recall even the most simplest of prayers. He died of illness after a year, at which point Baelor declared that an eight-year-old boy, whom he claimed to have seen speaking to doves who answered him in the voices of the Seven, should become the new High Septon. The Most Devout once again did as Baelor desired.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Baelor also ordered the construction of a new sept atop Visenya's Hill. Completed many years after Baelor’s death the Great Sept of Baelor became the new seat of the High Septon and the Most Devout, and a preeminent center of religious education in the realm.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Recent History[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]During the Great Spring Sickness, King’s Landing was one of the most affected areas. There, the High Septon, a third of the Most Devout, and nearly all the silent sisters died from the sickness.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Following the death of King Maekar I Targaryen, a Great Council was called to settle the issue of succession. The crown was quietly offered to Maekar’s third son, Aemon, who had taken his maester’s vows years before. The High Septon himself offered Aemon to absolve him from his vows after Aemon refused to break them. Regardless, Aemon refused.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Although King Aerys II Targaryen left a treasury overflowing with gold upon his death, King Robert I Baratheon has emptied the treasury, leaving the Crown in debt. The Faith is among those of whom the Crown borrows gold.	</Text>

			<Text>He Who Dwells Beneath the Waves[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Drowned God, also known as He Who Dwells Beneath the Waves, is a sea deity worshipped by the ironborn of the Iron Islands in Westeros. The religion of the Drowned God is old, dating back to before the Andal invasion, and the attempts of the Andal invaders to supplant it with the Seven all failed. The Drowned God religion supports the ironmen's naval, pirate culture.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]History[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The faith of the Drowned God teaches the ironborn that they came from the watery halls of the Drowned God, and were created in his likeness. The priests preach that the ironborn are related to fish and merlings, and not the other races of mankind. However, some ironborn rather acknowledge the more widely accepted view; that the ironborn descent from the First Men. In his manuscript Strange Stone Maester Theron suggests that the religion of the Drowned God originates from the undersea fathers of the Deep Ones.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Drowned God is said to have changed Nagga's bones into stone after the Grey King had slain her during the Age of Heroes, so that men might never cease to wonder at the courage of the first of kings. The Grey King's crown was made of driftwood, so all would know that his kingship came from the Drowned God.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The greatest of all the priests of the Drowned God was Galon Whitestaff, who decreed that ironborn must not make war on other ironborn and who forbade them to carry off each other's women or raid each other's shores. He also made the Iron Islands into a single kingdom, by calling a kingsmoot at Old Wyk in which Urras Greyiron was chosen. The priests of the Drowned God refused to allow the ironborn kings to name their successor a third time following the death of Urragon IV Greyiron. A kingsmoot was assembled on Old Wyk, but in the slaughter that followed half a hundred priests and prophets were among the victims.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Andals eventually reached the Iron Islands during their invasion. According to Archmaester Haereg they at first attempted to force worship of their own god, the Seven, onto the ironborn. The ironborn would not accept it, but did allow the worship of the Seven to coexist with their worship of the Drowned God. Although the Andals intermarried with the ironborn, the Drowned God remained strong on the Iron Islands and in time, most Andals on the isles converted. Harras Hoare was the first Hoare king to marry an Andal.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The priests of the Drowned God saw the Kings of House Hoare as ungodly usurpers. Archmaester Haereg suggests that the priests held that opinion because the Hoares allowed the Faith of the Andals to come to the Iron Islands for the first time. During the reign of Wulfgar Widowmaker the first sept on the Iron Islands was built on Great Wyk, but when his great-grandson Horgan gave his permission to construct a second on Old Wyk a bloody rebellion began, goaded by the priests. The sept was burned, the septon pulled to pieces, the worshippers dragged into the sea to drown. In retaliation, Horgan began to slaughter priests.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]King Harmund II Hoare was the first ironborn king who raised his sons in the Faith, although he practiced a self-made version of it. He accepted the Seven as true gods, but also continued to honor the Drowned God. He spoke about "the Eight Gods" and decreed that a statue of the Drowned God should be raised at the doors of every sept. Opposed by adherents of both religions, Harmund eventually decided that the Drowned God was an aspect of the Stranger. The priest known as the Shrike led a rebellion against Harmund II's heir, Harmund III Hoare. Within a fortnight, the king was overthrown. Harmund's younger brother, Hagon Hoare, was crowned in his stead. Hagon denounced the Faith, rescinded Harmund's edicts, and expelled the septons and septas. Within a fortnight every sept in the Iron Islands was aflame. Halleck Hoare, King of the Isles and the Rivers, spent most of his time in the riverlands and only nominally supported the Drowned God.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Following the death of Halleck's son, King Harren the Black, during House Targaryen's Conquest, the priest Lodos claimed to be the living son of the Drowned God. Lord Vickon Greyjoy allowed the Faith of the Seven to return to the Iron Islands in the aftermath of the Conquest, as King Aegon I Targaryen supported the Seven. In 37 AC Vickon's son, Lord Goren, crushed a revolt led by a man who claimed that he was the priestking Lodos, returned from having visited the Drowned God. Goren sent Lodos's head to King Aenys I Targaryen, who in return gave Goren leave to expel the septons and septas from the isles. It would take another century for another sept to open upon the islands.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In Lordsport stood a sept of the Faith at the time of Greyjoy's Rebellion, but it was not rebuilt it after its destruction during the war.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Recent Events[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Ironborn believe that the red comet is a flame the Drowned God has brought forth from the sea, which proclaims a "rising tide" for the ironborn. According to Aeron Greyjoy, it means that the ironborn are meant to go into the world with fire and sword as the ironborn of old did.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The priest Aeron Greyjoy summons the lords and captains of the Iron Islands together on Old Wyk for a kingsmoot. He rejects the claim of his older brother, Euron Greyjoy, to be King of the Isles and the North, insisting the godless Euron is not worthy to sit the Seastone Chair.</Text>

Thus, in Qohor, the Many-Faced God is called the Black Goat; in Yi Ti, the Lion of Night and in the Faith of the Seven, the Stranger.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This belief of a single god with many incarnations or 'faces' came to be reflected in the Guild's House of Black and White, which contains a public shrine with idols of many death gods, including the Stranger of the Faith of the Seven.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Beliefs[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The worshipers of the Many-Faced God believe that death is a merciful end to suffering. For a price, the Guild will grant the 'gift' of death to anyone in the world, considering the assassination a sacrament to their god. In the Guild's temple, those who seek an end to suffering may drink from a black cup which grants a painless death.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As the Faceless Men forsake their identities for the service of the Many-Faced God, they only assassinate targets they have been hired to kill and may not choose who is worthy of the 'gift' by themselves.</Text>

				The Great Stallion[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Vezhof is a horse god worshipped by the Dothraki, mirroring the importance of horses in that culture. The religious beliefs of the Dothraki are complex, as there is little division in Dothraki society between what in other cultures might be called "religion" and "custom".[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Beliefs[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Dothraki acknowledge the existence of other supernatural beings or spirits besides the Great Stallion, but it would be incorrect to describe them as polytheistic. Rather, Dothraki religious beliefs are best described as "henotheism" - the belief in and worship of a single deity (the Great Stallion), but accepting the existence of other deities who may or may not be worshiped. These other deities may only have power in specific localities. For example, the Dothraki do not revere or worship the Great Shepherd, the deity of the Lhazareen who live beyond the southern border of the Dothraki Sea. However, they do not deny that the Great Shepherd may exist, they just think its power is only strongest in Lhazar, and even then, that the Great Stallion is assuredly a stronger god than the Great Shepherd, in all times and places.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This belief system is evidenced in the Dothraki language itself: when planning an invasion of Westeros, Khal Drogo declares, "Anha aqorisok chiories mori, vazzafrok yal mori, ma afichak vojjor samva Vaesaan Dothrak!" ("I will rape their women, take their children as slaves, and bring their broken gods back to Vaes Dothrak!"). The word for "gods" which Khal Drogo uses, "vojjor", literally means "statues" - this word can refer to ordinary statues and sculptures, but can equally mean "gods", depending on context (similar to how the English word "idols" can literally refer to statues, but may also have religious connotations). As the Dothraki conceive it, every nation or people have their own "idols" or "gods", but the Great Stallion is the best one, and the only one they pray to. By physically capturing or destroying the religious idols of another people's gods, they believe they are defeating those gods.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Dothraki believe that the stars in the night sky are the fiery khalasar of the Great Stallion. They also believe that when they die, their soul will ride with their ancestors in the Night Lands, though only if their bodies are properly burned. Burning a Dothraki's body allows their ashes to rise up to the heavens, where their spirit will join the fiery khalasar of the Great Stallion.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In Dothraki belief, the moon is said to be a goddess and the wife of the sun, apparently part of the starry khalasar of the Great Stallion. This also indicates that the Dothraki conceptualize the moon as female and the sun as male.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Children are considered "blessings from the Great Stallion".[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Dothraki believe that a prophesied leader, the "Stallion Who Mounts the World", will one day unite all of the Dothraki into one khalasar and conquer the world.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Mother of Mountains, a lone mountain located within sight of Vaes Dothrak, is considered sacred in the Dothraki religion.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Practices[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Dothraki are a very brave but also a very superstitious people, believing in any number of signs and omens. A Dothraki khalasar will not go to war until the omens favor it, even if to all outside observers the time seems perfect to strike. Although they will honor agreements they have made, it widely known that the Dothraki "do things in their own time", waiting for favorable omens."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Dothraki religion does not include any restrictions on their lifestyle of pillaging surrounding peoples, killing their men, and raping their women. Nor do there seem to be rules against one Dothraki khalasar fighting another and enslaving the survivors. A successful warrior and mounted raider is highly esteemed.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The closest thing to a priesthood that the Dothraki have are the honored wise-women known as the dosh khaleen, crones who are widows of deceased khals. The dosh khaleen dwell in the only city of the Dothraki, Vaes Dothrak, located deep within the Dothraki Sea. They conduct many religious rituals, interpret all manner of omens, and are held to possess great powers of prophesy.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Carrying a sword or shedding blood within Vaes Dothrak is considered sacrilege, though should the need arise, loopholes such as strangling or burning a man to death are permissible.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The traditional Dothraki wedding ceremony is a daylong feast in which gifts are presented to the new couple. Displays of personal combat, duels to the death, and wild public orgies are commonplace at such a feast. A Dothraki wedding without at least three deaths is considered a dull affair. Because the Dothraki spend most of their time riding on the open plains, everything of importance in Dothraki culture is done outdoors under the sky. Thus, on their wedding night, a Dothraki couple rides away from the main camp to the open plains, and consummate their marriage under the stars.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Dothraki traditionally burn their dead in funeral pyres, so that their spirit may go on to the Night Lands. It is considered a terrible dishonor not to burn a dead Dothraki. The prospect of insects and worms eating through their corpse until it decomposes to nothing but bones is considered quite horrifying. Desecrating a corpse by dismembering or decapitating it, as one would cut up an animal, then leaving the individual pieces to rot, is considered tantamount to killing the corpse's soul itself.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Dothraki religion also rejects the employment of blood magic. For this reason, maegi are distrusted and hated by Dothraki.

			<Text>Dragonglass is volcanic glass, or obsidian. The children of the forest make weapons out of dragonglass, including daggers, blades, and arrowheads. During the Age of Heroes it was also recorded by the Night's Watch that the children of the forest gave the black brothers a hundred obsidian daggers every year. Dragonglass weapons are one of the few weaknesses of the Others. An Other that is pierced by an obsidian blade dies almost instantaneously. Obsidian blades are sharper than steel but far more brittle. The Valyrians called obsidian frozen fire and made use of obsidian to make their glass candles.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The smallfolk like to say that dragonglass is made by dragons, while Maesters say it comes from the fires of the earth. There are large deposits of dragonglass on Dragonstone, and it is an important export from Asshai. Mors Umber wears a chunk of dragonglass in place of a lost eye. </Text>

			<Text>The English dictionary defines despotism as "the rule of a despot; the exercise of absolute authority."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The root despot comes from the Greek word despotes, which means "master" or "one with power." The term has been used to describe many rulers and governments throughout history. It connoted the absolute authority and power exercised by the Pharaohs of Ancient Egypt, signified nobility in Byzantine courts, designated the rulers of Byzantine vassal states, and acted as a title for Byzantine Emperors. In this and other Greek or Greek influenced contexts, the term was used as an honorific rather than as a pejorative.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Due to its reflexive connotation throughout history, the word despot cannot be objectively defined. While despot is closely related to other Greek words like basileus and autokrator, these connotations have also been used to describe a variety of rulers and governments throughout history, such as local chieftains, simple rulers, kings, and emperors. </Text>

			<Text>The Red Keep is a castle on Aegon's Hill in King's Landing, the capital of the Seven Kingdoms. The Red Keep contains the Iron Throne and is the home of King Robert I Baratheon, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Red Keep is made of pale red stone and overlooks the mouth of the Blackwater Rush. The Red Keep has seven massive drum-towers crowned with iron ramparts. The castle is smaller than Winterfell and is patrolled by gold cloaks. Much of the Red Keep is connected underground.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Massive curtain walls surround the castle, with nests and crenelations for archers. Thick stone parapets, some four feet high, protect the outer edge of the wall ramparts, where the heads of traitors are traditionally placed on iron spikes between the crenels at the gatehouse. The walls have great bronze gates and portcullises, with narrow postern doors nearby. The castle also has great cornerforts. The immense barbican has a cobbled square in front of it. Behind the walls are small inner yards, vaulted halls, covered bridges, barracks of the City Watch of King's Landing, dungeons, granaries, kennels, and stables.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Relics of the Targaryen dynasty, such as dusty suits of black armor, sit in some corridors. Doors are made of oak banded with black iron. Sweet-smelling rushes can be spread on floors. The Red Keep is full of cats, including those kept as pets as well as strays, like a black tomcat.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Great Hall[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Great Hall contains the throne room of the king. The Iron Throne sits on a raised iron dais with high and narrow steps. A long carpet stretches from the throne to the Great Hall's great oak-and-bronze doors. The cavernous Great Hall is cavernous can feast a thousand people. It is oriented north to south, with high, narrow windows on the eastern and western walls. Skulls of the Targaryen dragons once adorned the walls, but King Robert I Baratheon had them moved to a cellar and replaced with hunting tapestries at the beginning of his reign. Small council sessions are sometimes held in the throne room.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Maegor's Holdfast[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Maegor's Holdfast is a massive square fortress inside the heart of the Red Keep. The castle-within-a-castle is situated behind walls twelve feet thick and a dry moat lined with iron spikes. Maegor's Holdfast includes the royal apartments, and the king's bedchamber contains a canopied bed and twin hearths.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Maegor's Holdfast contains the Queen's Ballroom, a hall only half as big as the Small Hall in the Tower of the Hand. The ballroom seats one hundred and has beaten silver mirrors behind the wall sconces which makes the torch's light seem twice as bright. Its walls are paneled with richly carved wood and it has a gallery above the main floor. High arched windows sit along the south wall.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Tower of the Hand[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Tower of the Hand contains the chambers of the Hand of the King. Its Small Hall is a long room with a high-vaulted ceiling and bench space for two hundred. The private audience chamber is not as large as the king's, but has Myrish rugs, wall hangings, and a golden-tinted round window that give it a sense of intimacy. The Tower of the Hand has a solar and a garderobe, as well as tall windows. Below the tower is the chamber of the dragon mosaic.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Other Buildings[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The council chamber hosts meetings of the small council. It contains a long table, at the head of which may sit the king. The chamber is richly furnished with Myrish carpet, a carved screen from the Summer Isles, and tapestries from Lys, Norvos, and Qohor. The chamber's door is flanked by two Valyrian sphinxes. The door can be guarded by a knight of the Kingsguard when the council is in session.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]White Sword Tower, located near Blackwater Bay, contains the chambers of the Kingsguard.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Maidenvault is a long, slate-roofed building located behind the royal sept. Its entry has two tall carved doors. The royal sept inside the Red Keep is located in front of the Maidenvault. There are seven altars, one for each of the aspects of the Faith of the Seven, and crystal windows are placed high in the walls. The castle also has a library.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Kitchen Keep is located at a courtyard across from the castle's main kitchen. Lord Gyles Rosby has spacious apartments above the Kitchen Keep, including a large bedchamber, a solar, a bath, a dressing room, and small adjoining chambers for servants. The Red Keep also has a small kitchen and a pig yard.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The godswood of the Red Keep is an acre of elm, alder and black cottonwood trees that overlook the Blackwater Rush. The heart tree is a great oak with limbs overgrown with smokeberry vines.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The rookery is the home of the ravens used by maesters of the Citadel. The Grand Maester has his chambers beneath the rookery.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The snug apartments of Lord Varys, the master of whisperers, are three windowless chambers with a hearth near the northern wall. Varys sleeps on a stone bed.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Dungeon[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Traitor's Walk is a pathway leading to a squat, half-round tower. The top floor holds cells for prisoners kept in a degree of comfort, such as knights or lordlings who might be ransomed, while the entrance to the dungeons sits on the ground floor. The other floors between contain rooms for the King's Justice, the Chief Gaoler, and the Lord Confessor. The dungeon entrance consists of a door of hammered iron and another door of splintered grey wood.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]King Maegor I Targaryen ordered that the dungeons below the squat tower have four levels. The uppermost level has cells with high narrow windows where common criminals are confined together. The second level has smaller, personal cells without windows for highborn captives. Torches in the halls cast light through the bars. The third level cells, the black cells, are smaller still and have doors of wood so that no light enters them, but they have not been used in recent years. The lowest level is used for torture. It is supposedly safer to go through the fourth level of the dungeons in darkness, because there are things one would not wish to see. The dungeon has twisting turnpike stairs and iron gates. A path from the lowest level leads to the chamber of the dragon mosaic below the Tower of the Hand and to the Blackwater Rush.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Secret Passages[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Red Keep and Aegon's High Hill have a network of secret passages and tunnels. King Maegor I Targaryen had them built to enable him to make a quick escape should his enemies ever trap him. The tunnels are supposedly full of traps. Some tunnels are of stone, while others are earth supported by timbers. Some of them are so small that a grown man must crawl through them. Some pass close to other rooms in the Red Keep, allowing a hidden person to eavesdrop on conversations.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The bedchamber used by Lord Varys contains a mechanism that causes his stone slab of a bed to float up and reveal a hidden staircase. One secret passage leads from the bedchamber of the Tower of the Hand to the chamber of the dragon mosaic below. There is also a secret way to get out of the Red Keep onto the cliffs facing the sea. Narrow handholds, impossible to see from the ground, have been cut into the rock so one may climb down to a trail beside the Blackwater Rush. Another passage out of the Red Keep leads to a sewer that empties into the river.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Maegor's Holdfast is the only building in the Red Keep that has no secret passages, as Maegor "wanted no rats in his own walls", except for one escape door that does not connect to any other passage in the Red Keep. Characters familiar with the secret passages include Maegor, Cheese, Lord Larys Strong, Varys and his little birds, and Lord Petyr Baelish.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]History[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Construction[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]At the start of Aegon's Conquest, Aegon the Conqueror landed at the mouth of the Blackwater Rush. On the highest of the three hills of the area, Aegon's Hill, he built his first fort of earth and wood, the Aegonfort. The new city of King's Landing, the capital of the Seven Kingdoms, developed around the fort. In  AC King Aegon I tore down the wooden Aegonfort so a more fitting stone castle could be raised for House Targaryen, tasking his sister, Queen Visenya Targaryen, and the Hand of the King, Lord Alyn Stokeworth, with overseeing its construction.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]When Aegon died at Dragonstone in  AC, he was succeeded by his son, Aenys I Targaryen, who was crowned at Dragonstone according to Gyldayn or in the foundations of the new castle in King's Landing according to Yandel. Aenys was obsessed with the new castle, which the people of King's Landing named the Red Keep because of its stone, but the king passed away at Dragonstone during the Faith Militant uprising in  AC. Aenys was succeeded by his brother, Maegor I. The Red Keep and the Sept of Remembrance were seized by Warrior's Sons and Poor Fellows, but Maegor eventually used Balerion to destroy the Faith Militant at the sept and solidify his rule.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Maegor took personal charge of the Red Keep's construction in  AC. He went beyond the plans of Aegon and Aenys by adding a moated redoubt, later known as Maegor's Holdfast, within the walls of the Red Keep. He also commanded that secret passages, false walls, and trapdoors be introduced to the castle and tunnels through Aegon's High Hill. After Prince Viserys Targaryen was tortured to death by Tyanna of the Tower in  AC, King Maegor abandoned his nephew's body in the courtyard of the Red Keep. Many members of House Harroway were thrown onto the spikes below Maegor's Holdfast when the king extinguished the family in  AC. When the castle was completed in  AC, Maegor threw a feast for its builders, carvers, and stonemasons. After three days of feasting, however, Maegor the Cruel had all of the craftsmen killed so that only he would know the Red Keep's secrets. With the Red Keep complete, Maegor then began construction of the Dragonpit. When Maegor the Cruel was found dead on the Iron Throne in  AC, one theory suggested that a mason familiar with the castle's secret passages had escaped Maegor's massacre and assassinated the king.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]King Jaehaerys I Targaryen chose Septon Barth, who worked in the Red Keep's library, to serve as his Hand of the King. The ashes of Jaehaerys and his queen, Alysanne Targaryen, were interred beneath the Red Keep after their deaths.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Dance of the Dragons[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Red Keep was a place of song and splendor during the reign of the generous King Viserys I Targaryen, but civil war erupted after his death with the Dance of the Dragons. Many men were imprisoned in the dungeons once Aegon II Targaryen took the throne. Blood and Cheese infiltrated the Red Keep and assassinated Prince Jaehaerys Targaryen to avenge the death of Prince Lucerys Velaryon at Storm's End.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Queen Rhaenyra Targaryen and her spouse, Prince Daemon Targaryen, landed in the outer ward of the Red Keep during the fall of King's Landing. Aegon's bride, Queen Helaena Targaryen, threw herself to her death from Maegor's Holdfast. Rhaenyra fled the city after the Storming of the Dragonpit, and Ser Perkin the Flea claimed the abandoned Red Keep for Trystane Truefyre. Lord Borros Baratheon recovered King's Landing for Aegon II during the Moon of the Three Kings, but the king was eventually found dead within the Red Keep after the Battle of the Kingsroad.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Lord Cregan Stark administered justice for King Aegon III Targaryen during the Hour of the Wolf in  AC. During the regency of Aegon III, the king and his brother, Prince Viserys, were besieged in Maegor's Holdfast for eighteen days by Ser Marston Waters. Ser Lucas Lothston, the master-at-arms of the Red Keep, was granted Harrenhal by Aegon in  AC.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Blackfyre Rebellions[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]King Baelor I Targaryen confined his sisters in the Maidenvault when he came to the throne, claiming it would prevent any carnal thoughts. Maron Martell, Prince of Dorne, submitted to King Daeron II Targaryen before the Iron Throne, after which the pair rode to the Great Sept of Baelor.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Ser Quentyn Ball, the castle's master-at-arms, helped Ser Daemon Blackfyre escape the Red Keep at the start of the First Blackfyre Rebellion. The Raven's Teeth of Lord Brynden Rivers garrisoned the castle during the reign of King Aerys I Targaryen. Daemon II Blackfyre was kept hostage below the castle by Bloodraven after the Second Blackfyre Rebellion. Ser Aegor Rivers was a prisoner in the Red Keep after the Third Blackfyre Rebellion, but Bittersteel eventually escaped to the Free Cities while traveling to the Wall. The murder of Aenys Blackfyre at the Red Keep by order of Brynden Rivers led to Bloodraven being sent to the Wall by King Aegon V Targaryen.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Mad King[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Lord Tywin Lannister, the Hand of the King to Aerys II Targaryen, desired to have his brother, Ser Tygett Lannister, appointed as master-at-arms of the Red Keep. The growing rift between the king and his Hand led to Ser Willem Darry instead being chosen in  AC.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Mad King remained in the Red Keep for four years after the Defiance of Duskendale, but he unexpectedly left the castle to attend the tourney at Harrenhal. His heir, Prince Rhaegar Targaryen, chose to reside at Dragonstone instead of the capital. Aerys tasked the Alchemists' Guild with using wildfire to ward off winter in  AC, the Year of the False Spring, and green flame burned on the walls of the Red Keep.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]After Lyanna Stark was abducted by Rhaegar, her brother, Brandon Stark, rode into the Red Keep to challenge Rhaegar. Aerys had Brandon and his companions arrested, however, and summoned their fathers to court. The king had almost all of them murdered, with Brandon and his father, Lord Rickard Stark, being executed in the throne room. Later during Robert's Rebellion, Rhaegar rode from the Red Keep to confront Lord Robert Baratheon, but the prince was slain by Robert in the Battle of the Trident.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Ser Jaime Lannister, a member of the Mad King's Kingsguard, held the Red Keep amid the Sack of King's Landing. Ser Gregor Clegane and Ser Amory Lorch climbed the walls of Maegor's Holdfast and slew Rhaegar's wife, Princess Elia Martell, and children, Princess Rhaenys and Prince Aegon Targaryen. Jaime wanted the king to surrender the castle, but Aerys instead wanted to enact his wildfire plot, with wildfire having been hidden throughout the city, including the castle's cellars. Jaime slew Rossart while the Hand of the King hurried to a postern gate, and then Jaime killed Aerys before the Iron Throne. Willem Darry eventually helped Aerys's surviving children, Prince Viserys and Princess Daenerys, flee Dragonstone before its assault by Stannis Baratheon.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]House Baratheon[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]King Robert I Baratheon claimed the Iron Throne after the death of King Aerys II Targaryen. Ser Aron Santagar serves as master-at-arms of the Red Keep, while Ser Ilyn Payne is the King's Justice. Grand Maester Pycelle handles the castle's ravens. Moon Boy and Orland are Robert's fool and bard, respectively.</Text>

			<Text>The Titan of Braavos is a massive stone and bronze fortress in the shape of a giant man, which guards the entrance into the lagoon where the Free City of Braavos is located. It is the primary line of defense for Braavos.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Titan is one of the nine Wonders Made by Man in the book written by Lomas Longstrider. When seen from the sea for the first time, the Titan is a terrifying sight.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The feet of the statue lie on two separate islands, including Sellagoro's Shield, and each foot is set upon a mountain. The islands are covered in soldier pines and black spruce. The legs and lower torso are made of the same black granite that form the islands upon which it stands; they were originally a natural stone archway, which was carved and shaped by three generations of sculptors and stonemasons. Above the waist, the colossus is bronze, its body filled with halls and chambers, its bronze breastplate punctured with arrow slits. One hand rests on the top of a ridge, its bronze fingers wrapped around the stone. The other hand is thrust into the air, holding the hilt of a broken sword. The Titan's head, rising four hundred feet above sea level, is crested with a bronze halfhelm, and has green-dyed hempen rope for hair. In its eyes burn large beacon fires, lighting the way back inside the lagoon for returning ships. The Titan's hips are encased in an armored skirt of a green bronze hue, the bottom covered in murder holes.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Enemy ships can be steered onto the rocks by the watchmen inside the Titan, and stones and pots of burning pitch can be dropped onto the decks of any that attempt to pass between the Titan's legs without leave. However, this has seldom been necessary; not since the Century of Blood has any enemy been so rash as to attempt to provoke the Titan's wrath.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Titan's Roar[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Titan lets out a loud roar whenever a ship approaches its entrance, to warn the Arsenal of Braavos. The roar is huge, a terrible groaning and grinding blast so loud it drowns out most sounds nearby, and can be heard across the lagoon in the city. The Titan also roars to herald sunrise and sunset, and the hours of the day are counted by its roar. During the anniversary of the Uncloaking, at midnight on the tenth day, the Titan roars to signify that the celebrants should all remove their masks.</Text>

			<Text>The Citadel is a complex of buildings in Oldtown that serves as the central home to the order of the maesters. The name is also employed to refer to order of maesters as an institution, or the higher placed members. At the Citadel, the residing archmaesters teach and train new students, and convene in the Conclave. The Citadel is funded by taxes from Oldtown and payments from lords for the service of maesters.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Citadel lies on the Honeywine, where its towers and domes are connected with arching stone bridges. Houses and stalls sit on the bridges. The gates are flanked by a pair of tall green sphinxes with the bodies of lions, the wings of eagles and the tails of serpents. One has the face of a man, the other a woman.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Scribe's Hearth[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Just inside the gates of the Citadel lies the Scribe's Hearth. Here, the citizens of Oldtown come to hire scribes, usually acolytes, to write and read letters for them. The scribes wait in open stalls for their custom. Other stalls situated at the Scribe's Hearth include those where books are bought and sold. Others offer maps.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Weeping Dock[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]From this dock one can get a boat for a short voyage to the Bloody Isle.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Seneschal's Court[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Outside the Seneschal's Court lies where acolytes and novices are punished for minor crimes, such as petty thievery.

At the far end of the hall there is a raised dais where a gatekeeper greets all those who wish to make an appointment to see the Seneschal.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Isle of Ravens[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Isle of Ravens is linked to the eastern bank of the Honeywine by a weathered wooden drawbridge. On the island is located the Ravenry, the oldest building of the Citadel. The walls of the Ravenry are covered in moss and vines and within its yard sits a weirwood tree on which the ravens like to perch. The white raven rookery is located in the west tower.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]History[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In the Age of Heroes the Ravenry was supposedly a stronghold of a pirate lord who picked off ships as they came downriver.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The origin of the Citadel is disputed, but House Hightower is generally considered to have played an integral role in its foundation. Most accounts on the Citadel's origins credit its foundation to Prince Peremore the Twisted, the second son of King Uthor of the High Tower. The curious Peremore invited numerous scholars, including wise men, teachers, priests, healers, singers, wizards, alchemists, and sorcerors, to Oldtown. After Peremore's death, his brother, King Urrigon, granted land alongside the Honeywine to "Peremore's pets", who developed the tract into the maesters' Citadel. House Hightower continues to be a strong patron of learning to this very day.</Text>

			<Text>The Eyrie is an ancient castle and seat of House Arryn, one of the oldest lines of Andal nobility, within the Vale of Arryn. It is situated in the Mountains of the Moon astride the peak known as the Giant's Lance, several thousand feet above the valley below. Although small compared to the seats of other Great Houses in Westeros, the Eyrie is considered impregnable to attack. During winter years, the Arryns seek refuge against the cold at the base of the mountain in the Gates of the Moon.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Eyrie is the smallest of the great castles, consisting only of a cluster of seven slim, white towers bunched tightly together. They can hold up to five hundred men. The castle is made of fine white stone. The towers encircle a garden, which had been meant as a godswood, but no weirwood heart tree would take root in the stony soil. The garden, which is overlooked by Lady Lysa Arryn's apartments, instead contains grass, shrubbery, and statuary.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The barracks and stables are carved directly into the mountain. The granary is as large as those found in much larger castles, like Winterfell. The Eyrie also contains a sept. The waterfall known as Alyssa's Tears can be heard from the Eyrie. The castle's household guard wear sky-blue cloaks.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The High Hall is a long and austere hall, with walls made of blue-veined white marble. At the end of it sits the throne of the Arryns, a seat carved of weirwood. It has narrow, arched windows, between which are torches mounted on high iron or silver sconces.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Moon Door is a narrow weirwood door that stands between two slender pillars in the High Hall. A crescent moon is carved into the door, which opens inward, and is barred by heavy bronze. The door opens into the sky. Most executions at the Eyrie use this door, which opens onto a six hundred foot drop to the stones of the valley below.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Crescent Chamber is the Eyrie's reception hall. Here, guests are given refreshments and warmed by the fire after making the climb up the Giant's Lance.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Morning Hall is located above the kitchens and is where people can break their fast.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Maiden's Tower is the easternmost of the seven towers of the Eyrie. From a balcony on the tower, one can see the Vale and the Giant's Lance.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Moon Tower contains the bedchambers of Lord Arryn.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Sky cells are the Eyrie's infamous dungeons. They are shelves on the side of the mountain's sheer cliffs, left open to the cold sky, with slightly sloping floors to unnerve the prisoners. Many prisoners, driven mad by the cold and howling wind, commit suicide rather than remain imprisoned.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Defenses[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]To reach the Eyrie, an invading army would have to overcome the Bloody Gate guarding the high road, then overcome the Gates of the Moon located at the bottom of the Giant's Lance and climb a narrow goat trail. Under normal circumstances this would take half a day, all the while being exposed to attack from the defenders in the Eyrie and its three waycastles along the path.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Stone, the first waycastle. The path to it is surrounded by forest. It has a massive ironbound gate. The stone walls are crowned with iron spikes and its two fat round towers raise above the keep.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Snow, the second waycastle. The trail to it is steeper than that of Stone. It consists of a single fortified tower, a timber keep, and a stable placed behind a low wall of unmortared rock. It is nestled into the Giant's Lance so as to command the entire pathway from Stone to Snow.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Sky, the third waycastle. The path to it is treacherous. It is open to the wind and the steps are cracked and broken from the constant freezing. Sky is a high, crescent-shaped wall of unmortared stone raised against the side of the mountain. Inside the walls are a series of ramps and a great tumble of boulders and stones of all sizes, ready to throw down or even cause a minor avalanche. There is a cavern containing a long natural hall, stables, and supplies. Handholds carved into the rock lead to the Eyrie, while earthen ramps give access to the walls. The Eyrie is located six hundred feet above this point.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]History[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Kings of Mountain and Vale[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Legends claim that the Winged Knight drove the First Men from the Vale and flew to the top of the Giant's Lance on a huge falcon to slay the Griffin King. Records indicate that the Andal king Artys I Arryn constructed the Gates of the Moon at the foot of the Giant's Lance, where he had defeated Robar II Royce's army of First Men in the Battle of the Seven Stars.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Artys's grandson, Roland I Arryn, believed that the Gates of the Moon was both inferior to Casterly Rock and the Hightower and strategically vulnerable to raids from the Vale mountain clans. Allegedly inspired by Teora Hunter, Roland decided to build a new royal palace high in the mountain above the Gates of the Moon.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Construction of the Eyrie took place intermittently over generations, and marble was imported from Tarth in the narrow sea, as Roland disliked the appearance of stone available in the Vale. The first maester to serve at the Eyrie was Quince. The Eyrie was inhabited as a pleasure palace for the Kings of Mountain and Vale during spring, summer, and autumn. The Arryns descend to the larger Gates of the Moon for winter and host a feast when they return to the Eyrie in the spring.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Targaryen Era[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]During Aegon's Conquest, Queen Regent Sharra Arryn fortified the Bloody Gate and the boy king Ronnel Arryn used the Eyrie as a refuge. Visenya Targaryen, however, flew upon Vhagar to the Eyrie's inner courtyard. Realizing that the Eyrie's location could not protect them against dragons, the Arryns submitted to House Targaryen and the new Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, Aegon I Targaryen.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Jonos Arryn usurped his brother, Lord Ronnel, and took control of the Eyrie during the reign of King Aenys I Targaryen. Once Lord Royce began hunting the rebels, Jonos threw Ronnel through the Moon Door. Prince Maegor Targaryen rode the dragon Balerion to the Eyrie, where he hanged Jonos.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Baratheon Era[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Eddard Stark and Lord Robert Baratheon were fostered at the Eyrie by Lord Jon Arryn. When King Aerys II Targaryen called for the boys to be sent to King's Landing, Lord Arryn refused and raised his banners in revolt, thus beginning what would become Robert's Rebellion. After winning the war, Jon was named Hand of the King to the new monarch, Robert I. In Jon's absence, the Eyrie was ruled by Nestor Royce, acting as High Steward of the Vale.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The singer Tom of Sevenstreams was once sent from the Eyrie by Jon's wife, Lady Lysa Arryn, and forced to take the high road.</Text>

			<Text>The Great Sept of Baelor, also called the Great Sept and Baelor's Sept, is the center of religious worship for the Faith of the Seven and the seat of the High Septon of the Faith. It is located in King's Landing, the capital of the Seven Kingdoms. The building is named after the septon-king, Baelor the Blessed. The Great Sept is rivaled only by the Starry Sept of Oldtown and the castle sept of Highgarden.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Great Sept of Baelor is named after the septon-king Baelor the Blessed. It is located at the top of Visenya's Hill, surrounded by a white marble plaza. It features a statue of Baelor, which stands tall and serene upon his plinth; his face is a study of benevolence. Large gardens capable of holding hundreds surround the sept.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The sept is an impressive marble domed structure with seven crystal towers, each of which has bells. Only on momentous occasions, such as the death of a king, are all of them rung. There are several sets of doors leading into the sept; septons use the Father's Doors, septas the Mother's Doors, and silent sisters the Stranger's Doors. Around the doors leading into the building is a raised marble pulpit from which a septon can address a gathering crowd.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Past the doors is the entrance hall of the sept, which is known as the Hall of Lamps. Those entering the hall walk beneath suspended globes of colored leaded glass. Through the double-doors is the sept-proper, with seven broad aisles which meet beneath the dome of glass, gold, and crystal. Its floors are made of marble, and great windows of leaded, colored glass, and the seven altars are set about with candles. Different altars are used for different ceremonies, depending on their purpose. For example, marriages are always conducted at the altar between two towering gilded statues of the Father and the Mother. The building has seven transepts.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Below are tombs where kings are laid to rest, cells for penitents, and vaults that hold costly vestments, rings, crystal crowns, and other treasures of the Faith. Thrice yearly septons from Baelor's Sept create heraldic drawings and illuminations for the White Book of the Kingsguard.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]During the reign of King Aegon I Targaryen, a sept for the smallfolk of King's Landing was made in a sunken cog in the Blackwater Rush, while the High Septon in Oldtown sponsored a grander sept atop Visenya's Hill. The Sept of Remembrance was then built on the Hill of Rhaenys to honor the late Queen Rhaenys Targaryen. King Maegor I Targaryen destroyed the Sept of Remembrance during the Faith Militant uprising, however, and replaced it with the Dragonpit.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Inspired by a vision, Baelor I Targaryen ordered the construction of a great sept atop Visenya's Hill; the fate of the grand sept atop the hill from Aegon the Conqueror's reign is unknown. The Great Sept was completed years after the death of Baelor the Blessed, and it replaced the Starry Sept of Oldtown as the center of the Faith in the Seven Kingdoms.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]When Dorne join the Seven Kingdoms during the reign of Daeron II Targaryen, the king rode with Maron Martell, Prince of Dorne, from the Red Keep to the Great Sept. The two men placed a wreath before the statue of Baelor the Blessed.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Ser Tywin Lannister, the Hand of the King to Aerys II Targaryen, wed his cousin, Joanna Lannister, within the Great Sept in 263 AC. Aerys made a walk of atonement through King's Landing to the Great Sept after the death of his infant son, Prince Jaehaerys, in 274 AC. Aerys's heir, Prince Rhaegar Targaryen, and Princess Elia Martell had a lavish wedding within the Great Sept in 280 AC. King Robert I Baratheon wed Cersei Lannister in the sept after Robert's Rebellion.</Text>

			<Text>House Hoare[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The seat of Halleck Hoare, King of the Isles and the Rivers, was a modest tower house at Fairmarket on the Blue Fork. His son, Harren the Black, built Harrenhal along the Gods Eye as a monument to himself, intending it to be the greatest of all castles in Westeros and for it to dwarf any other.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The construction of Harren's dream took forty years. Thousands of captives died in the quarries chained to sledges or laboring on the five huge towers. Men froze by winter and sweltered in summer. Weirwoods that had stood three thousand years were cut down to provide rafters and beams. Harren beggared the riverlands and the Iron Islands alike to ornament his dream.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Upon its completion, Harren boasted that his new fortress was impregnable. However, he did not account for Aegon the Conqueror and his dragons invading Westeros. On the day Harren took up residence, Aegon came ashore at what would become King's Landing. The dragons were not obstructed by high walls and forbidding towers and roasted Harren alive in the tallest of the towers, now known as Kingspyre. Harren and all his line perished in the burning of Harrenhal. Due to the extreme heat of dragonflame, the castle took on a charred, melted appearance.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Since Aegon's Conquest, the castle has become a white elephant. It is too big to garrison effectively and too expensive to maintain. Harren allegedly mixed human blood into the mortar for the stonework; some believe that the castle is cursed and haunted due to Harren's hubris and the horrors that have occurred within the castle's walls, with the early deaths of its many rulers as proof. The curse is thought to prevent any lord from holding Harrenhal indefinitely.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]House Qoherys[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]King Aegon I Targaryen granted Harrenhal to Quenton Qoherys, although Lord Edmyn Tully of Riverrun was named Lord Paramount of the Trident. House Qoherys died out during the reign of King Aenys I Targaryen, however, when Lord Gargon the Guest was slain during Harren the Red's rebellion.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]House Harroway[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Lord Lucas Harroway succeeded Gargon as Lord of Harrenhal, and House Harroway helped to defeat Prince Aegon Targaryen in the Battle Beneath the Gods Eye. The Harroways were extinguished by King Maegor I Targaryen in 44 AC, however.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]House Towers[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Ser Walton Towers was named the new Lord of Harrenhal after winning a melee announced by Maegor, though he died of his wounds within two weeks of the event. His son received Harrenhal, though not all of the lands formerly belonging to House Harroway, as Lord Harroway's Town was granted to House Butterwell and the rest of the Harroway holdings to House Darry. House Towers died out two generations later when the last Lord Towers died without heirs.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]House Strong[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Caraxes and Vhagar leap into the sky as the Battle Above the Gods Eye begins. In supplemental Blu-ray content from Game of Thrones Season 5.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Harrenhal was granted to Lyonel Strong while Jaehaerys I Targaryen sat the Iron Throne. The Great Council of 101 AC, in which Prince Viserys was chosen as the Old King's successor, was held at Harrenhal.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Lord Lyonel and his heir Harwin died in a fire at Harrenhal in 120 AC. It was blamed on the curse of Harrenhal, although non-mystical suspects included Prince Daemon Targaryen, Lord Corlys Velaryon, Lyonel's younger son Larys Strong, and even King Viserys I.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Early in the Dance of the Dragons, Ser Simon Strong surrendered the castle to Prince Daemon Targaryen during his assault on Harrenhal. Daemon used it as a base for the blacks to launch attacks in the nearby area. Prince Aemond Targaryen and Ser Criston Cole led an army of greens to retake the great castle, but found it abandoned by the blacks when they arrived. After the Battle by the Lakeshore, Criston led his soldiers south along the Gods Eye. Aemond rode Vhagar and ravaged the riverlands, including burning all wooden structures in Harrenhal. Daemon and Aemond later fought in the Battle Above the Gods Eye, a duel which killed both princes and their dragons, Caraxes and Vhagar, although Daemon's body was never found. Lord Larys Strong was executed during the Hour of the Wolf in 131 AC, ending his line of House Strong.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]House Lothston[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]King Aegon III Targaryen gave the ruined castle to Ser Lucas Lothston in 151 AC. The Bastard of Harrenhal was defeated by Ser Arlan of Pennytree in a melee in 193 AC. House Lothston was involved in the First Blackfyre Rebellion and helped to suppress the Second Blackfyre Rebellion with the might of Harrenhal. The Lothstons were cast down during the reign of Maekar I Targaryen, however, as Lady Danelle Lothston descended into madness.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]House Whent[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]House Whent, originally knights sworn to Harrenhal, became lords of the castle for their part in defeating the Lothstons.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Lord Walter Whent hosted a great tourney at Harrenhal in 281 AC. The famous tournament resulted in the crowning of Prince Rhaegar Targaryen as its champion, and is also noted for the participation of the mysterious Knight of the Laughing Tree. Ser Jaime Lannister was named to the Kingsguard of Aerys II Targaryen during the tourney. Prior to the outbreak of Robert's Rebellion, Rhaegar abducted Lyanna Stark less than ten leagues from Harrenhal. The Whents have been noted for their own tragedies. </Text>

			<Text>Black Stone Fortress[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The foundation of the Hightower is a labyrinthine fortress of unadorned black stone of uncertain origin on Battle Isle. While some believe it to be Valyrian in origin, Archmaester Quillion suggests it was made by the mazemakers and Maester Theron suggests it was created by Deep Ones, citing its similarities to the Seastone Chair. Valyrian origin is supported by the claim of Maester Jellicoe that Oldtown began as a trading post for ships of Valyria, Old Ghis, and the Summer Isles, predating the arrival of the First Men to Westeros. Septon Barth also claimed Valyrians came to Westeros because their priests prophesied that the Doom of Man would come out of the land beyond the narrow sea.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Kings of the High Tower[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]House Hightower of the Hightower is an ancient and noble family of impeccable lineage, as they were First Men kings during the Dawn of Days. The first chronicles that mention a "high tower" describe it as made of wood and rising some fifty feet above the ancient fortress. Later records mention taller timber towers. All of these served as a beacon to light the path of trading ships passing through the fog-shrouded waters of Whispering Sound. The early members of House Hightower lived amidst the gloomy halls, vaults, and chambers of the black stone fortress. It was only with the construction of the fifth tower, the first made entirely of stone, that the Hightower became a seat worthy of a great house. The king who demanded it and paid for its construction is remembered as Uthor of the High Tower. Some say this first stone tower, which rose two hundred feet above the harbor, was designed by Bran the Builder, while others say it was by his son, another Brandon.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Hightower and Oldtown were incorporated into the Kingdom of the Reach during the rule of the Sea Lion, Lymond Hightower.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Modern Era[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]During Aegon's Conquest Lord Manfred Hightower heeded the High Septon, who prophesied that the Hightower would burn with the rest of Oldtown if the city resisted the Targaryens. When Aegon the Conqueror arrived at Oldtown on dragonback, Lord Hightower opened his gates. Aegon spared the city, and the High Septon anointed him and acknowledged Aegon's right to rule the Seven Kingdoms.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]During the Dance of the Dragons, Lord Ormund Hightower's young sons remained at the Hightower while Ormund led an army for the greens.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Lord Leyton Hightower, the Old Man of Oldtown, has not descended from the Hightower in more than a decade.</Text>

			<Text>The Great Pyramid of Meereen is 800 feet tall (243,84 meters), from its huge square base to the lofty apex. A huge bronze harpy once stood at the apex.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Great Pyramid was built as an echo to the Great Pyramid of Ghis. Like its ancient predecessor, the Great Pyramid in Meereen has thirty-three levels, a number which is considered to be sacred to the gods of Ghis. Although Meereen has a score of lesser pyramids, none stand even half as tall.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The foundations of the pyramid are massive and thick, supporting the weight of the huge structure overhead. The interior walls are three times thicker than any castle's curtain walls. The servant's steps are the quickest way up and down the pyramid. These narrow, steep, and straight stairs are hidden within the thick brick walls. The walls in the hearth of the pyramid are eight feet thick. The outer walls are thirty feet thick (9.14 meters); they muffle the tumult of the streets and keep the heat outside. Consequently, it is cool and dim within.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The pyramid's main doors are closed and barred at sunset, opening only at first light the next day.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Layout[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Great Pyramid boasts three-and-thirty levels, a number sacred to the Gods of Ghis. On the ground level stables, stalls, and storerooms are located. The stables in the western walls hold horses, mules, and donkeys, while the stables in the eastern walls hold elephants. On the second level, the armory is located, as are the chambers occupied by Reznak mo Reznak during the reign of Queen Daenerys Targaryen. A training hall is located on the third level. During Daenerys's absence following the events in Daznak's Pit, her husband and consort, King Hizdahr zo Loraq takes chambers in the heart of the pyramid, on the sixteenth and seventeenth levels. During his stay in Meereen, Prince Quentyn Martell is given rooms on the thirtieth floor, two levels below the audience hall, which is located on the thirty-second level. The private chambers of Queen Daenerys Targaryen are in the apex of the pyramid, on the thirty-third floor.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Underneath the pyramid are vaults with cisterns, dungeons, and torture chambers.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Apex[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Daenerys Targaryen's keeps her private chambers (or queen's apartments) in the lofty apex of the pyramid on the highest step. Her chambers are surrounded by greenery and fragrant pools. There are low brick parapets.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Hall[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The queen’s splendorous audience chamber (or hall) is one level below her apartments,  down a broad marble stair. It is an echoing, high-ceilinged room with tiles and walls of purple marble. Tall candles burn amongst the purple marble pillars, Unsullied stand with their backs to the pillars.  Daenerys Targaryen sits upon a plain ebony bench that she has made her throne, having broken up the previous throne of gilded wood carved in the shape of a harpy.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Heart[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Massive brick walls surround a suite of rooms buried in the very heart of the pyramid on the sixteenth and seventeenth levels.   Hizdahr zo Loraq and the cupbearers of Daenerys Targaryen take up residence here during Daenerys' absence.

			<Text>Casterly Rock, nicknamed the Rock, is a castle and the seat of House Lannister. The capital of the westerlands, it overlooks the harbor of Lannisport and the Sunset Sea. Nearby strongholds include Kayce and Feastfires to the west, Sarsfield to the north, and Cornfield and Clegane's Keep to the south.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The household of Casterly Rock includes Maester Creylen, Vylarr, Ser Benedict Broom, and Whitesmile Wat.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Casterly Rock is carved out of a great stone hill colossal rock beside the Sunset Sea. It is popularly believed to resemble a lion in repose at sunset.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Casterlys of antiquity built a ringfort on the peak, and as millenia have passed its natural defenses have been expanded with walls, gates, and watchtowers. The base of the Rock contains large sea-carved caverns. The stone has been mined for thousands of years, so there are hundreds of mineshafts in the depths of the Rock, as well as yet untouched gold veins.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Rock has been measured at three times the height of the Wall or the Hightower of Oldtown. It is almost two leagues long from west to east, and contains tunnels, dungeons, storerooms, barracks, halls, stables, stairways, courtyards, balconies, and gardens. In the bowels of the Rock are rooms where caged lions were once kept, and cells for the worst prisoners. The castle contains a sept.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Lion's Mouth, the main entry to Casterly Rock, is an enormous natural cavern reaching two hundred feet high. Its steps are now wide enough for twenty riders. Its port has docks, wharves, and shipyards and is accessible by longships and cogs. From below the Rock thunder can be heard, where the sea comes in.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Golden Gallery contains treasures of the Lannisters, including gilded ornaments and walls. The Hall of Heroes is where the Lannisters and their close kin who have died valiantly are interred. The armor of Lannisters of old are also displayed in the hall. The Stone Garden is a godswood with a twisted weirwood a tenth the size of Raventree Hall's.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The region was probably inhabited by children of the forest and giants before the arrival of the First Men, and numerous animals have made it their home as well.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Legend says that Casterly Rock is named for the family that ruled it in the Age of Heroes, the Casterlys, who no longer exist. The Lannisters trace their rule over it back to Lann the Clever, who tricked the Casterlys out of their castle and claimed it for his own. Some claim that Lann still haunts the fortress, which has never fallen.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Kings of the Rock from House Lannister took their title from their seat, and members of the family founded nearby Lannisport. During the Andal invasion, the Lannisters eventually invited Andals into their realm and brought Andal youths to serve at Casterly Rock as wards and potential hostages. According to a lost scroll, Valyrian sorcerers believed their downfall would come from the Rock's gold.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Impressed by earlier visits to Casterly Rock and the Hightower, Roland I Arryn ordered the construction of the Eyrie as a replacement for the Gates of the Moon as the seat of House Arryn.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]King Gerold Lannister raided the Iron Islands and held one hundred captives in the Rock. Gerold the Great then hanged a captive whenever the ironborn threatened his lands. Before becoming King of the Iron Islands, Harmund II Hoare spent his youth at Casterly Rock as a ward.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]During Aegon's Conquest, King Loren I formed an alliance at Casterly Rock with Mern IX Gardener, King of the Reach, against Aegon the Conqueror. House Targaryen defeated the Lannisters and Gardeners at the Field of Fire, however. After the battle, Loren the Last surrendered his crown to Aegon and was confirmed as Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West. Visenya Targaryen is said to have been grateful that Loren rode to war instead of seeking refuge in his castle, as the Rock may have withstood even dragonflame.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The young Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen was once courted during a feast at Casterly Rock by the twins Jason Lannister and Tyland Lannister. At the start of the Dance of the Dragons, Tyland sent a quarter of the royal treasury to the Rock. The castle was left in disarray after the death of Lord Jason in the Battle of the Red Fork and the Lannister defeat in the Battle by the Lakeshore. Although Dalton Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands, was able to sack Lannisport, Casterly Rock was too strong for the ironborn once Lady Johanna Lannister barred its gates.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Lady Ellyn Reyne, the wife of Ser Tion Lannister, held a splendid court at the Rock as Lord Gerold Lannister declined in health. After the weak rule of Lord Tytos Lannister, his son Tywin restored the power of Casterly Rock.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]For much of 267 AC, King Aerys II Targaryen resided at Casterly Rock with Lord Tywin, his Hand of the King. Tywin repaid the late Jaehaerys II Targaryen's debts to Braavos with gold from the Rock.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Shortly after the birth of Tyrion Lannister, the young Elia and Oberyn Martell accompanied their mother, the Princess of Dorne, to Casterly Rock when she met with Lord Tywin.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Aeron Greyjoy was captured after the sea battle off Fair Isle, taken to Lannisport in chains, and spent the rest of Greyjoy's Rebellion imprisoned in Casterly Rock.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]When Tyrion Lannister became a man at sixteen, he was forbidden by Tywin from taking a tour of the Free Cities as his uncles Gerion and Tygett had done. Instead Tywin gave his son charge of the cisterns and drains at Casterly Rock.</Text>

			<Text>Background[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The tourney was announced in 280 AC by Lord Walter Whent shortly after he was visited by his brother, Ser Oswell Whent of the Kingsguard. The rewards offered by Walter were three times greater than those offered by Lord Tywin Lannister in the tourney in honor of Prince Viserys's birth at Lannisport in 276 AC. The lavish prizes offered by Lord Whent brought hundreds of challengers to the tourney. Walter also wanted to present his massive castle and his fine sons.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]While most believed House Whent was displaying their wealth and splendor, some believed the Whents lacked the funding for the prizes and were instead supported by a "shadow host"; Maester Yandel suggests Rhaegar Targaryen, the Prince of Dragonstone. King Aerys II Targaryen attended the tournament only because Lord Varys warned him that Rhaegar, his son and the crown prince, arranged the tournament as a pretext to meet with several high lords to discuss removing his father as king in an informal Great Council. Many in attendance were shocked by the king's physical decline. Lord Tywin Lannister was not at Harrenhal because of a quarrel with King Aerys, although many westermen attended.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Festivities[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]During the tourney's opening ceremonies, fifteen-year-old Ser Jaime Lannister was admitted into the order of the Kingsguard. King Aerys II Targaryen is said to have believed the cheering of the crowd was for himself instead of Jaime, and a young Pia was impressed with the handsome knight. Although Jaime wanted to compete in the tourney the next day, Aerys commanded him to return to King's Landing that night to guard Queen Rhaella and Prince Viserys.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Held that first night within the Hall of a Hundred Hearths was a great feast for lords from throughout the Seven Kingdoms. Besides Starks and Howland Reed, other northmen in attendance were Dustins, Hornwoods, Manderlys, and Mormonts. Lord Robert Baratheon drank wine with Ser Richard Lonmouth, and a wandering crow sought recruits for the Night's Watch. Benjen Stark teased his sister, Lyanna, for crying at the singing of Prince Rhaegar Targaryen, so Lyanna poured wine over her younger brother's head. Lady Ashara Dayne danced with a knight of the Kingsguard, Prince Oberyn Martell, and Lord Jon Connington. Brandon Stark convinced Ashara to dance with his shy brother, Eddard. According to Ser Barristan Selmy, Ashara was dishonored by a man at Harrenhal.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Tourney[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The tourney took place over ten days, of which the competition lasted seven days, with five days allotted to the joust. There was a seven-sided melee in the ancient style, in which Lord Robert Baratheon unhorsed many. Besides the melee and the joust, the tourney included an archery contest, an axe-throwing contest, a horse race, and a tourney of singers. There was also a mummer show.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Lord Walter Whent's fair daughter was the queen of love and beauty when the tourney began. Her honor was defended by her brothers and her uncle, Ser Oswell Whent of the Kingsguard, but they were all defeated in the tourney.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A mystery knight, the "Knight of the Laughing Tree", appeared in the lists to fight for the honor of a crannogman. King Aerys sent men, including Prince Rhaegar Targaryen, to learn the identity of the mystery knight, who appeared and disappeared mid tourney, but they were unsuccessful.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Prince Rhaegar was champion of the joust, defeating four knights of the Kingsguard, and in the end he chose Lyanna Stark as the new queen of love and beauty, placing a crown of blue winter roses in her lap. This was scandalous in that, not only was Rhaegar already married to Elia of Dorne, who was present at the tourney, but Lyanna herself was betrothed to Robert Baratheon.</Text>

			<Text>The Palace With a Thousand Rooms was the residence of the High King of Sarnor. It was located in the city of Sarnath, but it is now known by its Dothraki name, Vaes Khewo, meaning "City of Worms". Daenerys Targaryen passes the ruins of the great palace during the journey of Khal Drogo's khalasar from Pentos to Vaes Dothrak.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]History[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]High King of Sarnor was the title held by the monarch who ruled over the independent kings of the cities of the Kingdom of Sarnor. His seat was located at the Palace With a Thousand Rooms in the city of Sarnath. Though by law and custom all of the lesser Sarnori kings were his subjects, few High Kings of Sarnor ever exercised any real power.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Prior to the fall of Mardosh to the Dothraki, the kings of the Sarnori had remained divided, but the destruction of the "City of Soliders" and all its population led them to put aside their petty rivalries and ambitions and unite under their High King. Mazor Alexi assembled a great army from up and down the Sarne and struck out east. In the tall grass between Sarnath and the ruins of Kasath, the Tall Men faced four khalasars, with a combined might of eighty thousand horselords, in a battle that would be known as the Field of Crows. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Sarnori chariots smashed through the center of the Dothraki horse, killing Khal Haro and causing his khalasar to retreat. Alexi and his mounted cavalry plunged in after them followed by the Sarnori foot but it was a trap, the fleeing Dothraki turned and unleashed a storm of arrows while the khalasars of Khals Qano and Zhako swept in from north and south, while Khal Loso and his screamers struck the Sarnori rear. Completely surrounded, Alexi's host was cut to pieces. A hundred thousand men died, Mazor Alexi among them and a fortnight later, Sarnath along with the Paace was taken and put to the torch.</Text>
